I maybe be a bitch, but at least I'm a pretty bitch 
@FrankiStokes remember to be nice  good luck!!
If you wear a dress and heels to a football game, there's a very big chance I'm judging you 
My feet hurt so badly right now. I could seriously cry 
Happy football is back mad Giants are losing RT @marykstevens: Not even mad the giants are losing because I'm so happy that football is back

I have been waking up around 5am the past couple of mornings. This is not okay. 
My mini me likes to leave me notes while I'm studying  #studying #minime #geology #paleo http://t.co/Rla2xneIqB
I need a nap 
I wonder if it's acceptable to show up to lecture slightly buzzed on your first day of class 
It's good to be back!! @ Old School Pizza &amp; Suds http://t.co/3Vzcd2c85t
Happy 22nd birthday to my adopted Mexican brother  http://t.co/wViwz0Sl6j
Yesterday was the first time my mini me has said something to me that truly upset me.
WTF! Are you kidding me?  RT @WomensHumor: Finding a boyfriend is like finding a parking spot... Only the handicapped spots are left.
Ugh! Why am I so awkward around boys I find so freaking attractive?! 
I got tired of waiting and wondering if you were ever coming around.
@FrankiStokes @wycase oh Franki! What am I gonna do with you?!
@FrankiStokes @wycase what did you do?!
My mini me is now driving  #minime #stopgrowingup http://t.co/7Sg8Usj2Gw

I worked 14 hours today and I really need a foot massage and mommy won't give me one. These are the times I wish I had a boyfriend 
@redheadedprep that's how I've always got the best deals.
@redheadedprep search the book you need on Google and look through the different sites it brings up.
@FrankiStokes ugh. Tell me about it. #iwannagobacktobed
@FrankiStokes work 
I hope the rain keeps people out of the store long enough for me to get stuff done so I don't have to work another 12 hour shift 
@FrankiStokes bring me some!!
11:11 make a wish

I don't care, preseason or not, watching my @Giants win always puts me in an amazing mood, especially after a day like today 
It truly amazes me that some people have no sense of responsibility.
I popped my casino cherry yesterday!  http://t.co/8HKdSqFoYE
And we're laughing all the way to the river bank  @ Riverview Park http://t.co/7dokhIiMyU
I don't always wake up before 6am but when I do it's because @FrankiStokes and I are taking a mini vacation 
I forgot how nice it was to actually read a book that wasn't a textbook 
Ha! I'm funny @danielle2181  http://t.co/oqVOAkbL6A
"There are things you think and things you say out loud and they're very different things"
You said you'd always be there for me, but you're not. And it's because of me. It's my fault.

@FrankiStokes if you need anything let me know!
@FrankiStokes you can not get sick!
I make wishes, I have dreams, and I still want to believe anything can happen in this world for an ordinary girl.
I have an attitude and I'm not afraid to use it 
People don't just change because you want them too.
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? 
Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.

She should keep in mind there is nothing I do better than revenge
Please don't mistake my kindness for someone who actually cares.

Congratulations to my best friend and her fiance #engaged http://t.co/v0ATlTUkpv
And you've got your demons and darling, they all look like me.
My mother is ridiculous 
It's a song RT @wycase: @heathermrich Let what burn?
I think that you should, let it burn 

I'm predicting @Giants for the 2015 Super Bowl champions 

Oh you're offended by the things I say? Imagine the stuff I hold back! 
I never liked you anyways!
It's stuff like this that generally piss me off and makes me not want to be around you anymore.

Someday, I will find what I'm looking for... Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll find something much greater.
I may not be a saint but I have a heart of gold
I dont ever wanna feel like I did that day. Take me to the place I love, take me all the way!
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears, talk to the man who put you here and dont wait for the sky to clear.

Don't start with me. This is a fight you will not win 
I think Ive developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and stay in a relationship.
Say hello to my best friend http://t.co/wzXlMo18A0
