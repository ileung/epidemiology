a hot shower is exactly what was needed to give this awesome day an awesome ending ... 
Wonderland with the Ali clan 
@Aqsakhalidk hahaha thanks man, you're so much more beautiful 
holy shit.
only 10 hours till this young lady is a married woman, oh my god 
the wedding festivities has begunnn 
whaaaaaat my mom got her henna done and I didn't 
Alhamdulillah 
just hasn't been my week, or month.
cannot believe, that the woman who was just starting Uni when i was in grade 7, is bout to get married in less than a week, time flies
my uncle's here 
@hibaEthio I miss you so much, come back 
@RayIopez: All the time  http://t.co/t9kVrVuoPn @aye_deasis I found your life story
@HealthnFoodTips: Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach. This leads to impulse buying of bad foods. Me during Ramadan 

I'm literally a mini handy-woman
oh thank god, i fixed it
@Arshady_94 you were there weren't you?! I KNEW I SAW YOU, you passed by when i was in my car hahahah
waking up for the first round of Hershey is so hard, but t'was worth it http://t.co/rFJoeDTrDn
sittin on my bed for the past half hour debating whether or not to put on a face mask #Whatissleep ??
literally cannot believe it's the last day of Ramadan, like how??
too much water in too little time
@hibaEthio rest up babbbe, but sleep somewhere uncomfortable so it's easier to get up in a few hours
Was gonna stay up with Hiba during her all nighter before flight time, but it looks like she fell asleep herself .. Hm
so far I know that's what's going to be printed, I'll try to get a picture of it actually on the shirt asap
my cousin is selling these shirts for $20, all of the money will be donated to Gaza, if you would like one, msg me  http://t.co/pJvlcHvZIn
@hibaEthio you should regret it, you were like "ohhh don't worry we'll see each other at your iftar" can't talk with 20 other people babbe 
@hibaEthio leavin' me today, for the rest of summer, and I literally only saw her once, we suckkk 
yaaaaaasss @selenagomez 
I was literally shaking so hard during suhoor I dropped the pepper and made a mess lawdddddd
My sister is literally all I need
@hibaEthio I see that now ahaha
and once again I couldn't do it 
@hibaEthio go pack woman
why isn't someone awake with me when I need them to be, like the most needed time ever
@hibaEthio now if only you'd stop getting distracted and do it
this fever and cough needs to go, like please, there's 10 days left of Ramadan, go away so I can concentrate on Ramadan and not the fever 
Arlene you can't leave me like this
pizza for suhoor is such a bad idea but if I don't finish it it'll go in the trash
@aye_deasis what kinda cousin would I be if I didn't!?
and I'm soooooo gonna regret it after this week, dear lord help me please
I have no idea how to handle life without being able to come home and talk about everything with this kid
@ScarfMan24: THREE MORE DAYS TILL POPEYES omfgomfgomfgomfg I'm so excited right now
Arlene finds the weirdest things and people always after midnight oh my god 
@nadayle 
@nadayle fine, I'll just eat em then, you can keep waiting forever 
@nadayle your waiting will be over soon and I cross my heaaaart, just watch 
@nadayle it's Ramadan right now, can I get a rain check? 
@nadayle you want me to posts your grad pics ms.shield?
@nadayle hon hon hon.
@manalchaudhry I loveeeee you -heart eye emoji-
@nadayle the urge to slap you right now is unreal, no ice cream, but I love you too .. Still lookin for a nickname .. 
it was a pretty okay night for this sick person 
I'm gonna be so much more sick, but feeding people junk food makes me happy, and I got to do that, so it's worth it 
@nadayle awwhhhh *hon* you're great too 
@manalchaudhry I did 
@nadayle commmmmw back sometime soon or something, I'll save you some ahahahah 
@manalchaudhry shut up, you forgot the entire event LOL
@nadayle we were just cleaning and suddenly I'm like THE ICE CREAM. I'm sorry, in fact I thought of you when buying it now I feel bad ugh 
everyone come back over tomorrow, we got a box of pizza and chocolate peanut butter ice cream, lets feast 
Faiza and I forgot we got everyone's fav ice cream ..... oops
or just text Faiza, if you know her
of course I can't text or call when I need to the most-- if anyone needs to reach me just DM me or something
does the whole 'tampon up your nose" thing actually work when you're sick like in "She's The Man"
@ScarfMan24 this sucks man, and you too, feel better!
pleaseeeeesse fever go away, I have so much to do and prepare I can't be sick right now 

@aye_deasis CONGRATS GURRRL
Ramadan is the only time I can text most of my girls at 5am with certainty that they're awake

This woman (@AprilMaii ) ruined my entire day already and it's only 6am, I have the rest of the day to go thinking bout those stupid texts 
@AprilMaii if you can't handle me at fajr, you don't deserve my presence after  maghrib.. 
Nat always puts in new territories where I dunno what to say and make a fool of y self, she's like training for future friends
@Aqsakhalidk sammmmme, today I blame you, you distracted me 
Of course I remember that I haven't drank that much water all night  14 minutes before fajr
