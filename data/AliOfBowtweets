SWS were doing so well...and then Kellin decided to talk.
@squishymew YMAS just did one on the introducing stage.
That special place in hell that Shepherd mentions? It's also reserved for drunk girls who talk thro surprise acoustic sets. #shutup
Pop punk and donuts. #mymorningsofar
@mrdaveturner "Is it in a box?"
@SundayBrunchC4 One for Rob Beckett, STEVE!
Day 2: done. #Reading #randl14 http://t.co/mY66fshBPH
Gotta love a good confetti cannon. #Paramore #Reading #randl14 http://t.co/UFjR3g7FQg
@Alliana0x Enjoy, he was amazing yesterday!
@joemedforth @SquishyMew @daniellquinn Did iplayer not show the whole set? I have the acoustic bit on video.
Just remembered that I yelled, "Keep runnning!" as everyone was racing to see Gerard yesterday. I didn't manage a Korse voice tho.
Also got to spend some time with these two lovelies and the first banner. (Hope you spotted this @gerardway) http://t.co/aHKHxKuz4o
Saw Gerard kick butt on stage, meet Gerard, oh and then Paramore's sound went and we had an acoustic sing along to The Only Exception.
No words for what today meant. http://t.co/xTF7z13lXg
QOTSA "First time we played this stage it was 1 in the afternoon", pretty sure I was at that show. Nick got naked.
Drinking coffee and watching Brody Dalle with some of my fav people. Life could be worse.
Finally got to meet &amp; thank @gerardway after 13 years of him voicing the soundtrack to my life.
I'm hungry &amp; I need to pee, but there's no way in hell I'm leaving this signing queue.
Holy shit, it's good seeing @gerardway back where he belongs, owning that stage! #randl14
Almost time. #randl14 http://t.co/k331tSXhD1
@KilljoyKathleen @EmilyIsabelle @Becki_xo @aQueenRomance Haha, thought you might. Probs see you at the signing tent after :)
@KilljoyKathleen @EmilyIsabelle @Becki_xo @aQueenRomance Stage right or our right? I'm Frank side.
Second row, stage right. Hope you guys made it! // @KilljoyKathleen @EmilyIsabelle @Becki_xo @aQueenRomance and everyone else.
Band on stage before you open the gates, nice one Reading! #randl14
Queue anxiety. Get me to that nme tent already.
Hotel checked in to, wristbands on, pizza ordered. Just over 12 hours till it's @gerardway time!
@ReelBearMedia @twentyonepilots St Albans, UK. Far enough?
I don't mean tweets with a point, but things like, "Yea, that's great". Like why?!
Am I the only one who find it a little weird and creepy when a random stranger rewteets your personal conversation tweets?
@cawmrseagull It'll be so worth it tho!
@PoisonAndFire Awesome! I can't believe how soon it is now.
@PoisonAndFire Talking of venues, did you end up getting a ticket for the TBS/Used/Frank show in Columbus?
@yazmiibeckett @PoisonAndFire @jamesjammcmahon Do venue toilets ever?
@PoisonAndFire Unless you're @jamesjammcmahon who has been updating us from the loo xD
Things following tours teaches you: mad packing skills. http://t.co/Jg4MYuLnWq
@cawmrseagull I'm seeing Taking Back Sunday/The Used/Frank Iero as well, but the others aren't coming to that one. I couldn't miss Frank &lt;3
@SquishyMew Yep :)
@SquishyMew My sunday clashes are Young Guns/Masked Intruder and then 1975/Mayday Parade/Prides in the evening.
@SquishyMew That's what I was thinking too.
@SquishyMew That's the worst day for them.
@SquishyMew Apart from the alternative stage, but Bill Bailey just tweeted his set time. There's a clashfinder here http://t.co/VfOhzlIjcC
@cawmrseagull Yay for cookieland! We're in Ohio for most of it with a night/day in Pittsburgh somewhere in the middle.
@cawmrseagull Thanks :) We fly out on the 2nd, so excited!
@cawmrseagull They don't completely clash, so I might watch a bit of Young Guns and then go see Masked Intruder.
And don't get me started on sunday evening.
Urgh, Masked Intruder and Young Guns clash.
Anyone else getting random replies from like a week or two ago through on their mobile alerts? // @Support
Excited for the Hesitant Alien pre-order bundle. More people need to make zines.
@PoisonAndFire Now if he could just embrace it and give me and @KilljoyKathleen our Rock and Roll Suicide cover!
@grabyourwings As it should be.
I feel like I just watched a clip on TOTP2 after watching the No Shows video. I like it. #BowieVibes
@EmilyIsabelle Glad I wasn't the only one to think that. Salt in the wound much?!
@PoisonAndFire Ooh, I might actually be able to get this issue while I'm in America rather than hunting it down in London!
No, Reading, we don't wanna know about the bars, we want to know stage times and signing tent info.
@grabyourwings Because some of us enjoy them?
Dreamt I went to the Portsmouth show and it was all crazy lighting and puppets, including one of Geoff Rickley.
@shitdeweessays Can't manage Wednesday around work, but friday can't come soon enough!
@mikeyway Your turn to visit us next.
Important things I have looked up tonight: Taco Bell menu, Starbucks US menu, shops at Heathrow, when Pumpkin Spice Lattes are back.
@saidiebee #ticketstress
@saidiebee Yep :)
@saidiebee Aaaah, hope you get a ticket! It's a couple of hours drive for me, if I didn't have work the next day tho...
@feeltheweight I can't really afford it, plus I have to work at 9am on thursday and then drive to Reading in the evening.
@saidiebee I know! I'm waiting for the tumblr gif set of hot british men in wet shirts xD
It's lucky I have a Reading ticket cos there's no way I'd be resisting the drive to Portsmouth otherwise. Still kinda tempted.
@saidiebee John Barrowman did it yesterday and nominated David Tennent. I approve his choices.
Oh come on, @OfficialRandL, just gives us all the stage times already, some of us want to plan who to see before the last minute!
Crappy mood, play @PatrickStump - Spotlight on repeat, feel better. There's a reason I have these lyrics tattooed on me.
@feeltheweight @b3xy Never really listened to them tbh so probably give it a miss.
Guess it just goes to show how great @Writer_DG's descriptions are.
Drew up Lallybroch a few years ago, the glimpse we got of it in ep 2 of Outlander looked very alike! // @Writer_DG http://t.co/CHBSdIymtR
Hot chocolate and episode two of Outlander. That'll do nicely.
@hannybanana I don't have DPS and it's stupidly expensive on amazon at the minute! I think WDMC and Patch Adams are gonna get me the worst.
Oh jeez, the speech just before he gives up after finding Annie.
"Your mother's not in there, Ian!" And more tears. This film was such a bad choice, but I love it so much.
He found his daughter. Tears round one.
@saidiebee I don't know where my copy is, I only have it on video!
Went on Netflix to watch Hook, it's only on the US one, so now watching What Dreams May Come. This will lead to all the tears.
@saidiebee Did you see Chantal posted your pic to her instagram and tumblr?
Didn't think mum would appreciate coming home to find me sobbing over What Dreams May Come, so watching Alladin instead. #StillGonnaCry
Today's google doodle makes me want to read all of Diana Wynne Jones' books again.
@saidiebee I haven't for a while cos tattoos, but I did sign up to be a bone marrow donor the other day. Hope your mum is getting on ok &lt;3
Sometimes you just gotta sleep till midday.
@johnnyminardijr 30 and forever getting the, "Aren't you too old for that band?" line. Sorry, I didn't know pop punk came with an age limit!
@PatrickStump I haven't bugged you with this for a while, do you like my tattoo? http://t.co/fad5zr4XJQ
@Histrel Will do. Enjoy the Vampire Ball :)
One week till I see Gerard at Reading, 10 days till Stomachaches, 23 days till I see Frank in Ohio and 46 days till Hesitant Alien.
@cawmrseagull @b3xy @feeltheweight I'm on an early the next day and then going straight to Reading so I should probably give it a miss :(
@kierFVK Don't re-enact it!
All you need to know about tonights @fvkillers show is Club Tropicana is back. Oh and whole show was sweaty and great!
@joemedforth Don't suppose you're at The Horn tonight are you? #thingsimeanttoaskyouseveraldaysago
Late night #wcw shoutout for @BebeRexha https://t.co/qs8WfwJizm
Doing the sniff test on floordrobe items and belatedly realising the last place you wore them was a pit.
@AGirlAndHisCat I know that really, just the brain gremlins trying to convince mr otherwise.
@AGirlAndHisCat Same. Doesn't help that I realised, not including Reading, I only have four days free before we go.
Reading travel blogs rather than doing any of the things I need to do cos I have shitty pre-trip anxiety and it helps.
@cawmrseagull Ooh, which bit of America? It's just after I get back so gonna be fighting jetlag to go xD
@cawmrseagull @feeltheweight @b3xy Boo. Are you coming to Neon Trees in September tho?
@cawmrseagull @feeltheweight @b3xy I'm working in the day, but I can do the evening :)
@feeltheweight I think you'd really enjoy them.
@AGirlAndHisCat @donkeyjacket45 I second this.
Just discovered Neon Trees are playing V. @feeltheweight, you better go see them for me!
What's the difference between a British Citizen, a British National and a British Subject? Sounds like a bad joke but I'm filling in my ESTA
@feeltheweight @b3xy @elelel2 Half 4 which means I'd hit all the m25 rush hour traffic on the way down. You and Elle should go tho.
@feeltheweight @b3xy @elelel2 If I wasn't working Friday I would still be up for it, but it's too much hassle to get there after work.
Watching random Doctor/Rose episodes of DW on netflix and eating ginger biscuits. #comfortmodeengaged
In three weeks time I will be in America. How has it come round so quickly?!
Thanks @EricVictorino &lt;3 http://t.co/JiTNAmLsuZ
Every trending topic, except the sponsored crap, is for Robin Williams right now. I hope he knew how much he was loved even on the bad days.
@saidiebee Hugs all round. I'm too sad to even listen to Frank's new track right now.
My heart hasn't broken this hard over someone I never met since Heath.
Wherever Robin Williams ends up, I hope it's as beautiful as the heaven he creates in this movie. https://t.co/qb3ZmgptR2
Mental illness is real&amp;it's a cunt. We need to stop being so goddam afraid of admitting that so people don't think there's no other way out!
Oh Captain, my Captain.
Noo, not Robin Williams! :(
@AGirlAndHisCat Would it work without me bleaching first tho?
Thinking of going turquoise for america. #mermaidhair
Bless my mum, she came home from town with a bag of water balloons cos she didn't know gishwhes was finished.
@RachelKWrites @b3xy Better start stocking up on kale for next year xD
You mean this isn't how most bathtimes go?! #GISHWHES http://t.co/cNDNIK0ff5
@FrankIero Not NJ, but I am seeing you in ohio when I'm over from the uk in september.
Charging @b3xy in Starbucks #electrititty http://t.co/7mTCxdwHBg
Giving your kid a plastic whistle to play with on a busy train, A+ parenting.
@kierFVK Yep. Relying on you lot to cheer me up after KIGHs last ever show the night before!
Jack decided it was a great idea to lie at my feet while I clipped my undercut, so he now has some extra fur.
Well I have a parking ticket for Reading, now if my actual ticket could turn up, that'd be great!
Do me a gishwhes related favour please? Follow @OrlandoJones000! We need 86 more followers in the next 6 hours.
@Lowayyz Just that you need to be holding a sign with your name and location on :) Also if u managed any other items they need submitting.
@Lowayyz Can you post your mug shot on the gishwhes group please? Need to get them together and submitted tonight!
@aQueenRomance Back where he's made to be &lt;3
Coffee made, Paramore on, drawing board out. #gishwheshomestretch
@aQueenRomance Two weeks till our turn!
@aQueenRomance My week has revolved around work and gishwhes, with very little sleep squeezed in between.
@aQueenRomance There's a secret show? So out of the loop this week!
I don't know what the guy on tv is making, but he just used popcorn, white chocolate, marshmallow and coffee in one recipe!
@RachelKWrites Right? I am so ready for a post-gishwhes sleep!
Damp uniform and the prospect of an 11 hour shift are not improving my mood.
... and then there's the few I want to high 5 in the face for clearly not reading the rules!
24 hours of #gishwhes to go, the majority of my team I want to high 5 for being totally abnosome...
Can we pass one of these off as a teahouse?! #imissmya0board // @b3xy @sophie_xx @RachelKWrites http://t.co/pcnoqM7FRv
Used up nearly all my tunnelbear data watching it, but if they keep adapting Outlander that well, I'm going to be hooked.
@nylakh No way! The books are one of my all time favourite series'.
I need to go to bed, but I just found out tunnelbear works on the Starz website so I can watch the first episode of Outlander.
Petition for @kighofficial to play all the songs ever at their Cardiff farewell show, including Secret Santa even tho it'll be Halloween!
Nearing the halfway point and I have a serious case of gishlag. I just wanna sleep! #gishwhes
@ZoeeGrace All the ones we found yesterday were around the peter pan statue area.
The Weighted video is freaking great. It's like classic 80s kids movie gone bad, so basically very @FrankIero!
@realjohngreen Would you be willing to do a dramatic reading of part of this to help us with gishwhes please? http://t.co/vd6tONXgcl
Pretty cute seeing so many kids get excited over the fairy houses in Kensington Gardens today. #GISHWHES // @mishacollins
@cassieclare Hi Cassie, would you be willing to do a 15sec dramatic reading of this to help us with a scavenger hunt? http://t.co/wSo6icsvYC
@sisterspooky Thanks. It's a scavenger hunt item Misha as in Misha Collins from Supernatural &amp; Elopus is the hunt mascot (elephant/octopus)!
@sisterspooky Do you happen to know anyone who could help us out with this gishwhes item? http://t.co/C5rWgvoNOB
Pulled a box out from under my bed to get something from it, someone decided I was making him a cave. http://t.co/Gj6Zn7detU
KIGH played Diamond Days and Black Crush tonight. FML, why is Wales so damn far away?!
@aledsavedlatin Keep doing it then cos it makes some of us pretty happy too!
@beckycloonan @xojisokx @gerardway @TravellingManUK @ThoughtBubbleUK Yes, do that!
@elelel2 I actually more meant if we can find someone while you're over here. Wouldn't ask you to put yourself in danger &lt;3
@elelel2 Can you help us out with this one? http://t.co/luWJ7x6sYS
Misha lies, this list isn't on that blog. It is here tho. http://t.co/fqdAPJg6hR
@Writer_DG Hi Diana,we're doing this crazy thing called gishwhes,any chance you can help us out with this one please? http://t.co/HnfTUYSfZK
@sophie_xx Can't hurt to have more then one idea. I'm googling teahouses and bone marrow donation.
@sophie_xx Done :)
@sophie_xx I have Saturday too. London meet up? We can do Kensington Gardens then too.
@sophie_xx When are you off this week?
@sophie_xx Haha, yea I would still quite like a job by the end of the week!
@sophie_xx Also, where do we work next door to?
@sophie_xx Yes!!! Can we do number 19 in front of the gates?
@b3xy @sophie_xx I've loaded it to the group, check your gmail.
And there's that Stormtrooper item. @b3xy @sophie_xx
All that ticket stress page refreshing is good practise for the gishwhes list going live. I'm in!
The @gishwhes list goes live in an hour and then I can wave goodbye to any shred of sanity left in my life for the next week! #angishipation
@elelel2 @b3xy For once, no!
Sitting in the sun waiting for @b3xy and laughing at people trying to walk across the cobbles in heels.
@flunnery I don't think I'm seeing them again till the farewell tour now :(
