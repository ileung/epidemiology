I can't believe it's almost September.
Everything is better at target
#PSL is officially back in my life http://t.co/UGOltwA61d
Try to find the good in everything and nothing can go wrong.
My poor car is so dirty
Really about to start painting at 10 at night. What's wrong with us
@morganannroy that was all me
More sleep would be nice
Got 3 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours. My body requires like 10 of that 24 in order for me to function properly
Because they only have a fried shrimp emoji  #shrimping
The radio really needs to stop playing these Cabelas commercials.
Ohhh well that's good to know.
I never actually found the 'thrill' in going out #callmecrazy
My homework is irrelevant to me right now and there's nothing I can do about it  #ihatehomework
I'm so tired of hearing about this black/white shooting justice crap.
I love my life
I've been entirely too lazy today 
@kocmand RICE AND GRAVY
@kocmand I will be, Blake has school
Just goes to show you promise rings aren't worth crap. You shouldn't need a piece of jewelry to make or keep a promise. #highshcoolshit
If you deny your mistakes then you can't learn from them.
We're not friends if you only contact me when you need something.
Hope my dad comes back in a good mood
Almostttt 4 months til Christmas
That's what friends are for
This is the downfall of living so far away from your best friend when they need you this badly
Bubble baths are life.
I wanna go to Tennessee so dang bad
Maybe I shoulda put on make up for the first day of school.. But that takes too much effort
The next time you need something just wait how it's gonna be
Truth is I miss the friendship we had
A month ago I would be dreading to go to work on this busy Saturday. Now, it's the total opposite
I'd love to know why I'm awake.
Gonna kill another 6 pack just to watch it die
Put all your problems in Gods hands.
How is school gonna start Monday when Moodle ain't even updated from the summer 
This summer flew by and I ain't even mad at it
I don't understand how people lie so easily
Chase Rice's new album  #perfection
Pinterest has consumed my life lately
With Blake back in school I get lots of ME time and it's kind of relaxing... Until I get bored and eventually start cleaning everything 
Never having to worry about food or being hungry anymore is honestly the best  #luvmyjob
For once, I really don't feel like being at work
@morganannroy  And 6 more Mondays til Falll!!!!
10 and a half hour shift must be getting to me
I need to limit myself to one cabelas burger a week before I end up as big as a house
It's so hard not to get my hopes up for something 
Sooo many people are getting married
I love the fact that I don't have to look cute for work 
As long as I get that sweet little something late night kiss 
Sometimes I've just got to ignore all my thoughts and just enjoy what's around me at that very second.
It's been real ole dirtbike  http://t.co/02AIaK0CSz
Dusty head light dance with your boots in it 
It's like a damn sauna in my moms house
Here's to one good thing we've been waiting for
Is it weird that I wish I had work tomorrow orrrr..?
After these past few weeks I'm kind of obsessed with saving money and it's super weird
Luke Bryan came on my George Strait pandora station.... #isthisajoke
People are always worried about the wrong things..
@AAREN0 we miss you too http://t.co/dG9mamuNbH
@AAREN0 come back for two hours and you'll probably be sick of it again but nah I could never leave Louisiana!
@AAREN0 you coulda bought a north face from me
@AAREN0 If you had the right attire I'm sure you would be enjoying it a little more! I can't wait for winterrrrr
I'm just getting into Pinterest, and it might be the death of me.
So jealous of @AAREN0 getting to spend all that time with the beautiful outdoors 
Because my debit card gives me free stuff http://t.co/uRX94VK1ka
Now if someone would just buy this dirtbike...
Praying everything falls into place. There's a reason for everything
Hurry up cold weather
Yes it's true, and also very rare, but I'm wishing summer away.
@TheRealPSL welcome my love
Everything pays off in the end.
Hoping everything works out as planned.
Just cause I don't blow up my Instagram with pictures of me and my boyfriend doesn't mean we broke up?
I hate the fact that people don't understand that music changes as the generations change..
Ya bitch when I don't eat and ya bitch when I eat to much.
Anyone want a dirt bike
A selfie ain't nothing if your camera phone quality sucks.
It's so tacky looking to have to remove your 'promise ring' before putting on your engagement ring
My dad made fun of my rain boots
@AAREN0 noooo, cause I'm ready to see you
Don't come behind me riding my ass w/ your brights on just because I'm going 55 on a road I drive every night cause I won't go any faster
@kocmand  omg
@kocmand that's the wine!
@kocmand awe shoot, we always pick the wrong nights to stay there
@Malllibuu and flashing  twitter over here!!
People are so childish.. Like age doesn't even matter half the time.
I get so excited for work now
Lazy day
I miss @AAREN0 more than words could explain.
Well that's a sight
Why do people try being something they aren't

Changing departments feels like I work in a different store..
@chelsss_marie4 good luckkkk
After a year and 9 months, I'm not longer your Cabelas cashier
@chelsss_marie4 In the store. It's no new ones yet, just the ones from last year.
@chelsss_marie4 lol bath and body works fall candle preview
This probably made me more happy than it should have http://t.co/CkdPGpswfS
Done cleaning for the day
I will never depend on some body for money, especially a guy.
First time the bathroom has been mopped since my mom left
The hard part isn't choosing, it's living with the choice you make.
Finally my body let me sleep past 9
Where do June bugs go in the winter
Well that lasted for a cute minute and a half
Oh and why am I up before 8am, I'll never understand
I started watching OTH the Christmas after I graduated. I'm still not done, Cause I don't want it to end 
Pizza is life
@Nells4Prez_ hey at least they are on the dollar menu.....
@Nells4Prez_ rice crispy treats
@Nells4Prez_ well just guess what I'm obsessed with again 
Mood killer http://t.co/c8pVloWVes
@Starbucks is this real life
Im in the mood to shop, but I really should continue saving money
@Nells4Prez_ band camp weeek 
I don't want summer to end but I can't wait to wear warm clothes again. #andboots 
I get so bored with my hair sometimes.
Well that's convenient
People are like omggg tarpon rodeo, and they've never even been to Grand Isle #getreal 
And I have a living room again #deepclean
We have wifi 
Hot as a barrel on a 12 gauge sawed off.
Who the hell are you trying to fool
@AAREN0 jealous
Lord help me not lose my patience today 
Lord knows so much has changed
@AAREN0  indeed not!
It's almost been a year
Well that ended on a good note
One more day of this
What would I do if I lost my faith in you
We're just rockin with this moment let it ride.
I can't grasp the concept of how people say they are glad to be home from vacation... Like what planet are you from?
It's not always greener on the other side
Lord please open this child's eyes
She ain't into wine and dinin, she's shootin whiskey singin Sweet Child of Mine.
Whatever gets you high will always bring you down.
@Nells4Prez_ I remember she used to text you all the time 
It's been a good day
Now that I have rain boots without holes it probably wort rain anymore.
There's no way of stopping change from happening so don't even try. #changeisgood
Sorry, I just can't stand people.
I better start looking for a new place to live before Garyville gets this McDonald's 
Putting on makeup everyday is entirely too much work
Well that was a show....
Why are people trying to find a coke with their name on it to share with themselves.. It clearly says find your friends name?
I wanna go on a really long road trip.
It's rare to find someone without a tattoo anymore and that kinda makes me not want one #judgeme
If you need attention that bad, you probably need some sort of counseling.
This year has honestly flown by
Sometimes I just can't wait for the future, but then I think about everything and I know I'm gonna miss all this one day, so why rush?
I don't have work til two, and I'm up at 8. Something's wrong here..
I've went over 4 times on my data plan and my dad might just kill me. #oops
@kocmand lmao that's honestly all that matters then!!
@kocmand oh good lord, I hope y'all got more than two beds in there maybe some will pass out and forget to go to the room!!
@kocmand noo way, Blake hates anything to do with a large drunk crowd I had to beg his ass to go to BCSF!
Pictures don't do enough justice for all those crazy nights 
All my Grandisle memories are about to get brought up next weekend #lordhavemercy
Im so relieved I'm finally done with my summer class
One who comes to Cabela's in the rain is out of their mind
Coffee is life
You look like an idiot, straight uppp.
5 days left as a cashier, lord give me the strength
Being a picky eater saves me money and saves me pounds
My Monday felt like a Friday..
My days are all mixed up
Idk why I'm so excited for fall 
This generation needs help.
Sometimes it makes me so happy i get to say I'm not from ascension parish...
Being away from my boyfriend that long is a great reminder of how much miss him when we aren't together. &amp;Also how much he means to me.
@Kelcie_Gonzales yay
I can't believe how drunk my mom got yesterday 
Neither of my houses have wifi at the moment... #imwinning #myluck
@miadufresne kick starting my dirt bike... I guess I'm not so great with motor sports 
@miadufresne I figured
@miadufresne we'll look hot on the beach tho... http://t.co/RxeCqEFTXe
The Sundays I don't go to church with my boyfriend don't feel like Sundays.
No, women should not be able to walk around topless, regardless if she's breast feeding or not. It's a matter of modesty. #keepyourclotheson
Guess I should get out if bed some time soon
'Bae' is the most ignorant word ever created .
Then I'll probably get to the beach and still have half my paper to write ..
Packing is the absolute last thing I feel like doing
I can't stand to put my whiskey man on a leash 
I cannot wait for Starbucks winter flavors to come back
I can't believe it's almost September.
