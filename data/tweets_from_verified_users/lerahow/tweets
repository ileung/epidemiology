Going to go look at a Cube today! This could potentially be the best day of my life 
@sdstigall12 I did that yesterday 
@sdstigall12 She was yelling it to my dad and Jason. She's a piece of work.
Also, I'm having a sleepover with my mom like old times! But I'm going to bed before she is.. Who's the old lady here
My mom just yelled, "So long, gay boys!"  I've trained her well.

@nutt_meggg @haleypadgett @sdstigall12 @jnhJENNA YUUUUS
@jnhJENNA I literally ask my mom every day for them. On my Christmas list 
After my mom tried a mild wing at Bdubs, she said, "That'll put hair on your chest!"  where did she come from
@aud_estelle @AshBroyles that's what my smiley faces look like on your phone?! Weird
I had a dream last night that I had hair just like @HelloKenzie_   why?!
Today is the longest my hair has looked in a long time 
@morgthomas Good!!  can't wait :)
@morgthomas Hollaaa! Have her come in!!
@morgthomas: Thanks for doing my hair @lerahow. It looks gorgeous  I'm glad you like it!!  have so much fun!
@rjolden08 Riots...
@Numba1HPfan Happy birthday!! 
@sydneycatron Oh no.. What happened?!
@MuttCutts: Goodbye my loooove. @sdstigall12
I legitimately love Crossfit so much. Making me do things I never thought I would do before. Push your comfort zones and stay hungry people.
Going to bed with a messy room is ruining my routine. Just too tired tonight.
I either have nothing to do or five things I could do. Sweet.
This Thai Smile has lasted me almost a week. One meal could feed a family, gosh dang
I burn my mouth every time I eat a chicken pot pie. Every. time.
#tbt with my brother! #family #fall #fun http://t.co/EJEz6k4lcs

Hey unloving,
I will love you
Someone referred to my hair as a bob today  FINALLY
Deep cleaning my kitchen at 11:30 pm. I can't stop.
My favorite word is probably hussy
@cdawnstigall: IHOP with @sdstigall12 and they have discontinued the cinnastack pancakes, that's such a bummer WHAT
@katarinapaschal Now it's stuck in my head!!
Mark my words, I will drop everything
If you want it bad enough,
It'll come to you
@The_HelenKeller: Literally can't find anything to wear. @sdstigall12
Skim milk is not very good.
Everytime I do something fun, I never get pictures. What is that
Pita chips and hummus, can't get much better!
@sdstigall12 Where?!?
I love making myself a nice breakfast after a workout
@em_vonder Happy birthday Vonder!! 
So antsy today! Let's get this party started
Wearing scarves to sleep in was a really good idea 
Good God, can you still get us home
Happy birthday to my girl @sthurston23!! Thanks for being the best roomie and friend ever! I hope you http://t.co/d6xgljrf4h

@z_pizzle You should, I love it!
@Chaseolsheske Do you do it?! I've been doing it for a month now.
Okay, Crossfit just kicked my butt. 
John Mayer is the perfect driving music.
@calexander22 is there nothing going on tonight?!
Friday night, no plans so far and already in my sweats. Something is wrong here.
@CamShreds I've answered this already for you!
I am bouncing off the walls today! Cause my weekend starts in an hour
