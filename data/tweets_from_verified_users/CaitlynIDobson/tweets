I find it so annoying when you personally email a teacher and they don't respond, but yet they send out a mass email to the class 
Ok I know I'm a few years late on this bc I hate math &amp; have put it off but....THE MATH ZONE IS THE WORST THING EVER CREATED.
Couldn't survive life without @RoyRoyTheMalRoy http://t.co/TlaNsaHOA4
Well.... $140 bucks later I finally have a working car with a new battery 
Car battery is still dead. Stranded at my apartment and missed my first class because of it. This week is fun. 
Well if this particular Monday is any indication of what the rest of my Mondays will be like this year...I'm in for a treat....
Nothing could make a Monday better than a car battery dying....
I've been driving around for 20 minutes looking for a place to park. There is something so wrong with this.
I swear on everything if parking doesn't get better as the year goes on I'm going to freak out
