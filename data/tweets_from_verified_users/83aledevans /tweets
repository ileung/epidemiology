@zaazaazoom I bet! I heard about it back in Jan/feb. Just a rumour. So wasn't 100% sure it would happen and it did!
@JAmbrose31 I send these kind of snapchats to my mates daily! Got to be done lol
@zaazaazoom yes I loved that too! Kind of knew it was going to happen though. I can't keep away from spoilers
@zaazaazoom same here. But I kind of feel like that's the BBC's master plan. They don't want us to like him or trust him at first.
So @zaazaazoom what did you think?
How do you know what I'm tweeting if you don't follow me?
@johndoejrr @YoAnty1 will try them out. Thanks

Lucky I'm in shoreditch today as the wooly hat and shorts combo wouldn't go down well anywhere else.
