Took off my ring to do yardwork and forgot to put it back on to go get a rototiller from @Randizzle151 's mom and feel so naked w/o it. 
Guys, Bob is taking me to lunch :')
You know you're a responsible adult when you go outside to do yardwork by your own free will AND you put sunscreen on to do so.
Starbucks blueberry muffins are so good!

I'll never understand why girls are so in love but when they break up with their boyfriend they'll talk to any guy that's interested.
I would seriously die if any of my dogs went missing

There are some people you can just look at and know that they'd be the parents recording their child fighting someone.
Was thinking about when I was younger and my dad would drive my friends around and we all fit in the mini van and thought"vans aren't bad"
Nev from #catfish is ruthless. Puttin' these losers in place 
@caitlynkbandoni okay ill see you tomorrow! 
@caitlynkbandoni I just made food! Are you working tomorrow night?! I'll get one then. 
Was gonna ask @caitlynkbandoni if Papa Murphy's had dessert pizza and just go for it, but I found some ice cream instead.
@caitlynkbandoni are you at work right now?
I want Papa Murphy's but there's not a chance in hell I'm leaving my bed.
Prom?
Why don't I have a friend that just wants to hang with me and do crafty stuff :(
If my boss watched the cameras at work she would see Quintin and I throwing cheese and egg at each other. 
I just want wings
How do I end up staying up so late after I've been tired all damn day and have to wake up so early tomorrow 
Ruger just threw up all over our room because he decided it would be a good idea to ingest a pair of my underwear earlier :-)

I don't know if my puppy doesn't shit in the house, or if he just eats it immediately after doing it so I don't even know it happened.
@chrisfelcher omfg 
@Tiger_rG @CaulkHires I'm pretty sure they were trying to quote that lil Wayne song and put beyonded when it says beyond it :p
Today I'm gonna be a #ladyrancher http://t.co/h2TXSuQU7b
It's pretty crazy that people my age are having kids when I'm nowhere near ready to even start thinking of having them.
Well that made my night exciting!
Just witnessed a high speed chase 
The shower is my favorite place to chill out
@YoBoyEloy yes! Hahahah @Randizzle151
@romer_16j I'm going to do both!!!!!!!!!
To be responsible or not...
@WorldStarFunny: IM DONE  http://t.co/84Mb1u5TSQ @Randizzle151
One of many reasons why I love Kristopher: he lets me tell him everything that happens with The Bachelorette. 

@TheFunnyVines: No chill https://t.co/M61mgt5KnB @Randizzle151 
@xBerekWright I spy a cutie in there 
I think I'm going to have french toast for breakfast
The most realistic thing Kristopher has ever said to me http://t.co/pdWPuOHbKG
@caitlynkbandoni hahaha my dad wanted to move here and now I can't leave him all alone 
@caitlynkbandoni my whole family lives in the bend area so I get to go up there whenever 
@caitlynkbandoni floating the river there is really awesome too! :)
@caitlynkbandoni my grandparents live there! It's awesome in bend
I don't understand how girls my age can date guys that are almost forty.
People with jersey accents are really annoying
Ava is trying to bury something in my pillows :')
Seriously?
Some girl in a BMW z3 was just rockin' out to "My Humps" at the stop sign
@Keriberryyy wind?
Just made a bomb ass sandwich 
You know how in Jurassic Park that dinosaur sneezes on the people in the tree? Guinness just did that to me
I don't remember if I was supposed to text Kristopher or if he was going to text me..
When I get my ring cleaned 
@caitlynkbandoni eyebrow piercings are just terrible in my opinion! It would ruin your pretty face!
@caitlynkbandoni not the eyebrow 
@emilyycutieface http://t.co/Yr4WfiNX0P
I think I'm going to go dark with my hair just because as I get older it gets darker and bleaching it sucks and destroys it 
You can go fuck a rock because that's the only girlfriend you will ever have
Do you think that before texting they sent dick pics in the mail??
Currently planning to turn our ashes into fireworks to be launched together after we die  @meridithfischer
@bigdsbbmama THIS IS AWESOME 
@kris_brown1992
When you see my face hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell. 
Seriously heartbroken
Kristopher is shaving his beard off. Excuse me while I go cry my heart out.
@Tylor775 I know but it doesn't keep me awake 
Every day after work I come home, drink coffee, then pass out.
Getting a new puppy 
@zayners25 FUCK YOU I WAS GOING TO TEXT YOU BUT YOURE A JERK SO NEVERMIND
Honestly I don't do a lot of anything when he's home 
Whenever Kristopher is home I don't make it to the gym. Not even one single time 
I've napped twice today and I have to be up at three thirty am tomorrow. Let's just say I'm not getting any sleep
Cuttin it closeeee
-70 percent of Starbucks customers
"I can't even pronounce the drink I'm ordering, nor do I even understand what it is, but I'm going to be a douche when you explain it."
STOP THATS WRONG
People of Fernley: Spend some time with your shitty families, pray to Jesus, and stay the fuck away from Starbucks.
@SeanLewandowski WHERE DO YOU EVEN COME FROM WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN
Just read this thing about a spider in someone's bed and now I'm freaked out. 
Wish Kristopher was here to cuddleeee

Well that's definitely fucking wrong
Using public restrooms makes me disgusted at the way some women decide to use them.
Kristopher and I are so romantic that we feed each other Chinese take out. 
We ripped them out anyway. Hahahha
Today Bob told Kristopher to dump me because I didn't want these ugly ass trees in front of the house and Kristopher did 
I'm just going to vomit instead
I want to go inside and sleep but as soon as I fall asleep Kristopher is going to come get me to leave. I just know it. 
The milk fridge gives me internal anguish
I don't know why I keep trying to pretend that I can keep white clothes white.
Drunk
Wtf
Josh said he wanted a house made out of Guinness' ears 
My neighbor just called and said "I put some donuts on top of your car two hours ago! Get up and go eat them!" Bob is so cool. 
Sleeepyyyyy
@Randizzle151 LOLOLOLOLOLOKOKOL
OMG JIM YOU DONT HAVE TO TALK TO ME EVERY SINGLE TIME I WALK BY YOU
http://t.co/Fsc3kYf12E
July Fourth was mine and Kristopher's first holiday actually together and he's home again this year too. 
Throwback to last July 4th @twills020 @Jose_Garcia203 @romer_16j http://t.co/SxwC5knlAY
@chrisfelcher  tell them you promise to make it next year and use your get out of jail free card!
@chrisfelcher sleeping in and missing lawn mower races should be illegal.
@Tylor775 
Would it be acceptable to go to bed right now?
Just watched the grossest video about the inside view of sexual intercourse. 
I need some glass cleaner
