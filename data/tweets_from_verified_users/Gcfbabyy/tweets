@codymyonly my thoughts are with you, your friend, and her family. I'm so sorry for your loss, let me know if you need anything 
But I don't watch that show so I do give a shit lol
Live tweeting is one thing but why would you tweet about a character dying that's just not fair
My cousin gets taylor Caniff's tweets sent to her phone 

It's extremely scary admitting something is wrong but it's relieving once you get help
Tbh therapy never helped with me if you're struggling with depression consult your doctor and try and get on medication! 
Take a step forward in your recovery and get medical help. Tweeting about harming yourself will get you no where.

My aunt wants to eat it for dinner I feel so bad the poor thing http://t.co/XOlTqkbG5z
HIS VOICE http://t.co/4yXGBmahv5
Really not feeling this new fan club especially with school now/soon most of us don't have the time to do the activities on it

@codymyonly my thoughts are with you, your friend, and her family. I'm so sorry for your loss, let me know if you need anything 
But I don't watch that show so I do give a shit lol
Live tweeting is one thing but why would you tweet about a character dying that's just not fair
My cousin gets taylor Caniff's tweets sent to her phone 

It's extremely scary admitting something is wrong but it's relieving once you get help
Tbh therapy never helped with me if you're struggling with depression consult your doctor and try and get on medication! 
Take a step forward in your recovery and get medical help. Tweeting about harming yourself will get you no where.
