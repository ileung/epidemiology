@beerooke34: #WCW Goes to my beautiful bestfriend @tateschultz30 http://t.co/yDbT1YwrQFlove you 
Got accepted to my first college! 
PLL 
This cold better be gone within the next couple of days
I wanna be surprised
Why does @beerooke34 and her boy have to be so cute?
I can't believe by the time I'm done with high school I will also be considered as a Sophomore in college with my credits transferring 
Distance means nothing if a person means so much to you. It's the effort that you put into it that makes it work. 
Seniors! Don't forget to bring $4 for spirit wear by Friday! @PresHansel5 @KaileyHeise @SheWillFly_ @kenadulin @alewellen21 #passontheword
@beerooke34 you always know what to say to cheer me up 
Love having @beerooke34 as my best friend. No matter what she is always here for me

I don't wanna go to school

So much for that 
I want my car back 
I'm going to miss my boyfriend  #1week
After working on my online assignment for 3 hours, have to restart.
I'm in desperate need of a shower
I'm such an impatient person
This is annoying
Stupid traffic jam

Tired.

I'm turning 18 in  2 days
I get to spend a full week with @CalebHerrema on our vacation 
I'm ready for this house boat trip
The past couple of days have been amazing with my boy
Back on the court with my team again 
Cool I have a seat belt tan line across my chest. That's what I get for have a convertible
@sydneyjadeska Congrats on graduating!
Soreeee
I had my first physical contact practice today
Back off 
My teacher just told us that if your diggin your crush, on the fourth date you should just rip one at the dinner table to know it's real
My brother may be stronger than me but he sure couldn't keep up the pace on our run tonight 
In two days, I will be a senior. In three days I will be playing in my first basketball game since November 27. Hard work pays off. 
It makes me so mad when someone takes my charger 
You never leave my mind
Can't seem to focus
Even though I'm really tired, I can't seem to fall asleep
Why is it so cold in my house?!
Trying a new church tomorrow and I'm going by myself 
Can't wait to start playing with the my team in 2 weeks!!
I hate when there is no hot water after washing all the cars. I need to shower!
@Juicysluisy  and @CalebHerrema need to check their mail 
On my way to pick up my pictures 
I need to be by myself right now.
First practice today since November 25 
I can never get enough of looking at @CalebHerrema and I's prom pictures
