Setting my alarm for 3am to get up for work tomorrow. Wah.
I'm ready for Christmas now
Starting to get dark early again...
The conversations I've been listening to on the way home from work today have been quality #thankyoucommuters
@YourEyesLieUK ordered shorts over a month ago, youve taken my money but I havent received the item. Even worse, I've emailed &amp; got no reply
Just saw a ran-over cat and now I'm gonna be so sad all day #ripkitty #sad #cry
I love it when my morning-self remembers to pack a bag of sweets for my after-work-self to eat on the way home #atreatfrommetome
I don't understand people who don't wear fake tan 
When I leave home for work in the day its too warm for a coat. When I leave work for home its too cold without one #catch22 #itscoldouthere
@gillainey my beautiful leg is ruined  #sobs
Still so pissed that one night out clubbing almost 2 months ago has left an open hole in my leg 
I will never get over how hot Orlando Bloom is as Legolas 
Fuck this hurts
Wah a wasp just stung me in my neck ouch ouch ouch ouch :(
Having a little weep on the bus over Robin Williams. I hope he has finally found peace
Ebola is actually scaring the shit out of me
Just goes to show that people don't always feel on the inside the way that they appear on the outside #RIPRobinWilliams #youwillbemissed
Saturday night vino 
1st class has been opened up to everyone because this train is so packed! Never heard of this before #thankstfl #guessyourenottotallyshit
Time is ticking and soon it'll be too late
Think its a joke that people actually sleep outside footlocker to get huaraches as soon as they come out #notgotanythingbettertodo?
I would give sooo much to be able to go and see the Spice Girls again #reunionplease
'Cause you never were and you never will be mine
Hunty is my new favourite word. I can't stop saying it. Hunty hunty hunty.
Must be the money 
@TheBiancaDelRio is my absolute idol  #rupaulsdragrace
Today I read an entire book just on my way to and from work
Just saw Margaret from The Apprentice filming an advert about rubbish in Croydon haha
This is so true  http://t.co/3Q7T3cWrpm
Just got ID'd to buy a pepsi #wtf
OMG SO EXCITED!! Ru Paul's Drag Race series 6 is now on Netflix 
How the fuck is it August tomorrow!?
We are our choices
Here is a list of companies that test on animals. Shocked to see so many big brands listed http://t.co/sEqYtG4B43 #peta #stopanimaltesting
I really really really want to go to space 
Getting a seat on the train in the morning makes me feel like I've won the lottery
Just saw this couple on a date and the guy asks the girl if she wants him to buy her an ice cream. And she says no. Clearly she's insane.
I wish I had not cut my hair off 
You still break my heart
Finally found an episode of Catfish when the person actually is who they said they were!! #shocked #finally #catfishmtv
So restless
@xbeccaedwards awwwhh poor little Becca Billy no mates
@xbeccaedwards I wish I could retweet this but your profile is private B 
@xbeccaedwards ahahaa this is us on point!  #bitchesforever
I have become addicted to McFlurry's
The hottest love has the coldest end
The kids at my local primary school's year 6 leavers disco are literally dressed like they're going to prom. Calm down you are 10.
Fair to say my diet is going well. First day and I've had pizza and ice cream #iregretnothing
Cannot express how much TFL fucks me off. Why do I pay so much for such an awfully shit service!? #tfl #tflyouareshit
@xbeccaedwards ahaha I wouldn't be admitting that B! I'm bored of it already and I accidentally didn't give my person a name wah fail
Did I actually just download that Kim Kardashian game!? What is wrong with me 
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today
I wish I was a sea turtle 
When I was younger I really wanted to be the twins in The Parent Trap. Now I'd happily be Meredith #bossbitch #favefilmever
For once could tfl actually put the disruptions on their website, rather than cancelling all trains and not telling anyone #anothertflfuckup
My level of anger right now is unreal 
I heard you're a player. Well, I'm the coach.
Girls, unless you're wearing something high-waisted don't wear a crop top.
And Tangled. Always Tangled.
All I want to do right now is lay in bed, and watch Mulan
Hurt doesn't even begin to cover it.
I find it so hilariously fake when someone bitches to me all the time about someone else but then is completely normal to them in person
Today has been one huge day of betrayal 
So mad.
 http://t.co/L7OShmqMmC
It all seems like yesterday, not far away 
Work, eat, sleep, repeat.
@gillainey #bowdownbitchez
@gillainey that was a good time, do it again! Give me a crown this time though
The guy who "would never fuck a croydon wench" has just taken a piss in someone's garden. No sane croydon girl would even go near you!
@gillainey I will never get bored of disney karaoke!!
@gillainey oh for sure my mental age is about 4 #disney4life #ilovedisney #letmesingyouasong
@gillainey I do I do
@gillainey you do look young though!!! I just look young because I have a fat face :( wah wah wah sad
Overheard on the bus: "I'm not fucking any croydon wench, you'd need an std test after that" .. Err mate you're not such a catch yourself
@gillainey well then it got worse, I said "actually I'm 21" and he said "shit you're older than me then" so I'm old &amp; young at the same time
@gillainey just kidding, luv ma momma
@gillainey women need to learn!
Just got told I look like a 14 year old. Fucking great.
"@FriendsReactss: #ThingsMoreUsefulThanBrazilsDefence The left phalange on an aeroplane" HAHA
@gillainey this is exactly me ahahahaaaaa!!!
Haven't left the house without nail polish on in three years and today I have and I feel disgusting!!
This weather can't make its mind up, hot cold hot cold hot
You are my glass half empty, sipping my ocean dry
Dreams don't work unless you do 
Nothing quite annoys me like seeing people post on facebook/twitter but not replying to a text...
This bus smells like a Toby Carvery
I'm never gonna let you go
People who get the same train as me are going to start calling me "sleeping girl" at this rate #imtootired24/7
Sleep more on the train to and from work than in bed these days!!
Why do I get emails from Tiger Tiger in Leeds. I've never even been to Leeds!?
Two dickhead teenage boys harassing me at the bus stop, can't even understand what they are saying they are so stupidly illiterate #youths
Overheard on Oxford Street, middle class british people problems: "can we please go to john lewis because there is air con"
@gillainey I am I'm watching series 1, lovvvveee it! Sashay you go away!
@gillainey can't believe I've only just discovered it!! I'm addicted
RuPaul's Drag Race is my new favourite programme
Just had my first bubble tea. Hated it. #gross
@TheLadBible: Well this is awkward.. http://t.co/aALRbx7ffg this is hilarious  (but I do agree with saving the elephants though)
Need a new series to watch on Netflix  any suggestions?
@gillainey thanks Gilly 
@catmarieyianni thanks chica! 
This exact minute 21 years ago my princess self was being born into the world
If you're going to lie, then please, at least do it well enough not to get caught 
99% sure I just walked past Pippa Middleton!!
Pissed to be any England fan who actually went to Rio
@joeholding I'm not getting my hopes up for that haha we will probs get it about 3 days late I'm sure!
@joeholding thank you! I have never felt more relieved, most stressful months of my life
JUST FOUND OUT I GOT A FIRST IN MY DISSERTATION AHHHH 
Where did the sun go!?
Hampton Court Palace is so beautiful, I never get bored of going there. Favourite place in the UK by far!!  http://t.co/E3mIOQ03vt
Potentially the most embarrassing moment of my life just happened. Tube doors closed on me, I got trapped and had to be prised out from them
Maleficent was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. Bit of a let down tbh #disneydisappointment
But on the plus side I did have THE most fun at work, got to dress the mannequins
Very disappointed to find that the Walls pop up in Victoria does not, as I had thought, give out free ice creams #whataletdown #gimmedatice
Addicted to Orange Is The New Black 
@xbeccaedwards ahahahaa #mynameisamy what Muhammad doesn't know, doesn't hurt #freewineftw
@xbeccaedwards ah love this! Probs one of my fave tweets ever  had such a lush day chica, cant wait for our proper reunion #croydongals4eva
Where can I buy a slush puppy from?
Or rollerblades
I want a bmx to ride to work
Mumford sesh
Why do I know so many fake fucking people!? Urgh get out of my life
What a great idea of mine to wear sandals today. FUCK.
@catmarieyianni hope you had a wicked time in Cancun!! Let me know what's going on with your phone so we can arrange to meet up chica xxx
These are the most ridiculous escalators I've ever seen! Are people that lazy?? http://t.co/mWF288DMOq
Why am I SO socially awkward!?
@SammmB_ it actually makes me feel like an idiot! How can it be so difficult to match tiles together, so shameful
Everytime I play 2048 I get more and more frustrated that I cannot get 2048  #amistupid?
I live in a world of never knowing what day of the week it is
Took a "which queen bee are you?" quiz and got Blair Waldorf, yesssss! #feelinglikeawinner #gossipgirl #xoxo http://t.co/qUjvSiUBs3
#awkward
Home. Now. Please. http://t.co/fBSXylppK9
I want to go on holiday 
I just want to sleep 
So nervous 
I enjoy @LOTRReactss tweets way more than I should
@LOTRReactss: when someone won't answer their phone, but you keep trying anyway.. http://t.co/7O8u2VyTet hahaa this is the funniest thing
Love that my module leader has put a tab behind the local bar for us  #readyforit
There isn't much I wouldn't do to meet @Jamiebower 
The pain of not being able to read the last Mortal Instruments book that has been released today because I need to revise  #thesacrifice
Fucking loving the video of Louis and Zayn smoking a joint, hilare! #rolluprollup
Trying to do my revision, but all I can think about is whether or not that kid from Kerching ever made that million pounds 
Loyalty &gt;
Animals have rights too!! http://t.co/rzWAglVJxb
Why are people voting Croydon as an unhappy place to live. Where's everyone's hometown spirit!? I fucking love Croydon 

Love a good thunderstorm  #faveweather #cosy
#foreverscrolling
I want to go to sleep but I also just want to ipad
@LOTRReactss: "Do you think you've done well in your exams?" http://t.co/vV6Xov4QVY how I feel about my upcoming law exam
You can't judge a person, or and entire political party, on appearance - that's ridiculous! #labouralltheway #edmiliband
I feel sorry for Ed Miliband and people thinking it is okay not to take him seriously because of his appearance. I'm backing you Ed #labour
Okay I get it now
I think I'm stupid because I just do not understand the game 2048
This is hilarious  http://t.co/bMnAWbmsoK
So relieved that my A Level Textile teacher had kept my work this long, thought all my efforts had gone in the bin #phew #neverworkedsohard
I'm more concerned with the neatness of my revision mind maps than I am with the revision
It saddens me how shit I am at Candy Crush 
Pepsi Max  #truelove
@ge_humphreys LOL Elsa is a "moody bitch who lives in an ice bitch palace" #clearlythecolddoesbotheryouanyway http://t.co/MwQqbTVftG
I just want to watch Friends.
Brian May is planning to buy a shooting estate just so he can shut it down. If I had that money I would be doing this too! #savetheanimals 
I definitely think that insects can sense my fear and they gravitate towards me because of it 
Setting my alarm for 3am to get up for work tomorrow. Wah.
