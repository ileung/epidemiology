Losing interest by the second
I just lost all interest.
@TastyMaurice in that case I probably will see you, nooo D; haha jk
@TastyMaurice Oh really? Haha What hours?
@TastyMaurice Yea, all day 
@TastyMaurice How is that? o.O
@TastyMaurice That doesn't count because we weren't even interacting at that point :p I'm pretty sure you'd be a bad wing man xD
@TastyMaurice I can't pull bitches with you around though  haha
@TastyMaurice I bet by next week you won't even remember to try and look for me x)
@_cinthiahoran @lilyisbadass looks like it's gonna be a date night for you guys, #5 said she wants to go tomorrow for a girlies night x)
@_cinthiahoran @lilyisbadass But I just ate ;___; haha let me ask Chanel No.5 and I'll get back to you
@TastyMaurice Correction, your class was right next to me! Haha
@lilyisbadass is it just you and Brian? xD
@TastyMaurice Wow, now I gotta find a new hangout spot... xD
@lilyisbadass Whaaaat, well this is news to me haha
@TastyMaurice  No need to get so defensive haha why'd you even move locations instead of staying by the library?
@TastyMaurice Funny was watching you get at a girl xD I was just sitting there laughing haha
@TastyMaurice Right here :p
@lilyisbadass Why on a Wednesday? Haha
An hour's worth of lab today involved a thumb wrestling tournament  totally didn't win
Held bae-to-be's hand today 
@YudithLovesYou Yea, the only bae-ish person in the class so I'm no longer upset xD
Wow, I really just ended up in an all guy group...
I can't take a guy in sandals seriously
Thought I had found a girl crush in bio but she's kind of a stuck up bitch so I went with or nah
@TastyMaurice like I said, I'll hide better next time! 
@TastyMaurice I'll hide better next time haha
I just want to go home and look at my shoes. They're beautiful!
You guys, this is funny haha
Hahaha wtf Mauricio ended by me but not with me. He's getting at a girl 
@HeffronDrive Waddup!
@TastyMaurice Sucks to suck haha I just made two 'friends' who sat next to me xD
If Beautiful could just walk by right now that'd be great. I'm feeling daring haha
@TastyMaurice Well then looks like you're gonna stay a loner haha
@TastyMaurice Make a friend then obvi haha
"@TastyMaurice: Fuck you ace!" 
@TastyMaurice Alright, I'll be sure to not go over there XD and I'm places... haha
@TastyMaurice Yea :p Where you at?
@TastyMaurice Are you on campus?
Next class isn't til 4 :(
It's 9:12 and my mom really just tried to claim ' wow, look at the time it's so late. It's already going to be 10' 
Laughing at you 
I see him Monday-Thursday so it's inevitable that he'll reach the "totally-bae" mark haha
So semi-bae is becoming pretty-bae, and I'm sure by next week he'll be totally-bae 
@OhhNoo_Maria Haha yea I saw it, and I thought it was hilarious that you tagged me in it xD
All he did was appear in the video. I had such high expectations for the song too 
I had never listened to Rihanna's "Rehab" in its entirety so I watched the video because it said "feat. Justin". Well, he didn't even sing!
@x_Squanto_x  I was joking haha
@YudithLovesYou Alright maybe you'll do a better job than me, oh and preferably one next to bae haha
Gonna have to switch seats now 
Yea, looking at this guy again he is totally bae 
@x_Squanto_x So what's the party info?
@YudithLovesYou Well, she definitely looks like one... xD maybe next time she won't do it again haha
@YudithLovesYou My mind. Probably why she didn't get the memo and sat down xD
@YudithLovesYou This girl next to me totally stole your "reserved" seat like two minutes before you walked in haha
I just want to take a nap. I'm tiiiiired.
@_cinthiahoran Is you on campus?
Thought I saw Beautiful so I started making my way towards him, but it was another guy :(
Saw some coworkers. How awkward.
This girl really just came and killed my vibe
@TastyMaurice Never been to those. I prefer the 4th floor restrooms in the math and science building haha
I'm seriously just sitting in here on the counter killing time.
There's some mad nice ac in this restroom. I never want to leave.
@x_Squanto_x and that's why you should've had sushi instead haha
@x_Squanto_x It was the non-chinese made donuts :p
That was unnecessary.
There was one bae in math though, so that's kind of cool. He's still nothing compared to Beautiful 
I think this class had a 'no bae material' policy because these people are all weird
I'm hungry
Totally sounds like me http://t.co/UIncb5jGyo
I'm semi on point today, so it'd be a good encounter haha
I really wish I could run into beautiful :(
@_cinthiahoran Can't, I'm currently baeing someone up hahaha
My next class isn't til 4. I should walk around campus and bae people up
Wow you guys, I'm nervous haha
I have two classes tomorrow. That means two classrooms to scope out for the bae of my life haha
I'm gonna be so alone ;(
I'm actually pretty nervous about school
"@RileySmith: In honor of our final night filming #trueblood ..I present, photo booth fun on set. http://t.co/ttfK2l4Kfi" bae 
I will refrain from subtweeting. Making progress. Go me 
@Jane_saysss #BILLFUCKINGDIED
Alcide and Bill would die, but not Eric. Robb and Oberyn would die, but not Jaime. Everyone I love dies, but Yannely's men live wth
7 seasons later and it's over 
My feels just hit another level. Things weren't supposed to play out that way wtf 
I'm so tired
I can't right now
The feels man
Off of work early, spent my day training, and I'm now certified as an operator on another ride. Good day 
My supervisor needs to stop being so cute though, like I'm trying to work
TIL my manager and supervisor are idiots haha
I should really get sent home early. I mean c'mon, my ride is down. I doubt they need me here that bad.
Not totally dreading today. Minus the fact that I got no sleep so I'm gonna feel crappy all day haha
Dying af
Really fucking cool.
That's cool.
Fuuuuuuuck
By the time I get home it's 11. Idk what there is to possibly do at that hour or who would even want to do anything for that matter
I feel like going out tonight after work
If I were to mention the things he's done he'd get fired, but that's fucked up 
I swear it feels like I'm doing both our jobs
As a person this guy is cool, but as an employee he sucks so bad
Totally looking forward to a 10 hour shift yay 
Well, I'm drained 
If anything this is good. Finally give my emotions a break because I've been putting them through too much haha
I'm actually gonna take my horoscope's advice this time. Gonna let this one go and move on.
I don't want to overreact but I'm really worried. I don't know what to do...
I wonder if I'll ever get back into drinking and partying. Right now I'm so over it though.
My natural hair was so beautiful. Man wth did I do to it? 
@Jane_saysss Yea I was like wth is going on haha I'm gonna go ahead and still leave you hanging though
"@Jane_saysss: Tell me I'm a screwed up mess, that I never listen, listen" 
Godney, place Beautiful in my path again  haha http://t.co/FtboWYUmEv
I hope this semester I see Beautiful again. I'm ready to stop being a pussy, so I'd actually make an approach 
@Jane_saysss Fdb yannely, fdb. Remember that, and you're golden. Your new bae will come in due time haha
I have all this love, I can't just keep it to myself haha I want a guy to spoil with materials and emotionally, ya know?
I hope this semester I find a bae. An actual official bae though. That would be nice.
My horoscope says my heart deserves the best. I think it's right haha http://t.co/7QtA6nw0cF
Oh my goodness. I felt something tugging on the end of my blanket and I got so scared. Turns out it was a cat 
Wow, I just realized something. This is awkward 
I have connections to my arcade baes now 
Every day at work I meet a new coworker of mine haha
So much shadiness
Or nah. That's my baby.
My Grandpa fell in love with my dog and wants to buy her off of me haha
Feels like a Saturday 
@krisqueesha Alright cool then I say we do it Wednesday because Monday feels too soon haha
@krisqueesha Just checked my schedule and I can do Mondays and Wednesdays up to 12:30. So idk how that twerks for you haha
@krisqueesha Hmm idk because I'll be in school all day 
@krisqueesha Oh damn 
@_cinthiahoran Wow wth haha What classes are you taking?
@_cinthiahoran My books are expensive regardless 
Wow, I think I'll just drop all my classes haha fuck books man
Dude, fuck out of here
Every time we both touch I only want more
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
Can't ever get it right no matter how hard I try, and I've tried
I wish it was me that you'll call later on 'cause you wanna say goodnight
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder whenever I'm near you
I wish
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young! @Jane_saysss @lilyisbadass @_cinthiahoran @RosenthalRosie

Lots of baes at Santa Monica
Wow Yannely, Rosie, and I almost got bae'd up by super cute baes  We didn't play our cards right though haha
Not even done with today and it's already been too much for me 
My mom would be so pissed if she knew where I was driving around right now haha
Idk how to feel anymore
Probably gonna die from this 
Stupid cat clawed my thigh and now I'm feeling this weird burn inside it
