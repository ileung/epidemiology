HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVORITE BROTHER @GYounghans!! I love you, man!! stay classy tonight! 
@Melissaaa_Annnn http://t.co/Pi7i7eBUTu
@Dsnitzky have a good first day of school, little buddy!! play nice with the other kids and make sure you share!! (especially w/ bitches)
do men actually realize that they're assholes?
or are they just as clueless to it as they are when it comes to "where do babies come from?"
ohh boy open your eyes, a girl like me ain't waiting all night 
I think I have a better chance of finding bigfoot than I do of getting a hold of @DWhip2.

@MelissaTooShort

I was in a bad mood, and then I remembered my cole swindell georgia southern hat to comes in tomorrow 
I wanna drink till I dont feel the urge, to run back to you and lay it down. make. me. yours.
#infinity
it should be illegal for someone over the age of like 26 to take a #selfie. it just gets weirddd after that point. 
you and tequila make me crazy 
well, somehow I managed to lose a goldfish... 
maybe I need to lie more often because so far, honesty has gotten me nowhere in life.

which is completely pathetic.
that awkward moment when the undies you're currently wearing are featured on #ThongThursday and you have a brief moment of panic  #notmyass
but maaaa, spy kids is on!!
da faq is this?! if your going to hack me you probably shouldn't tweet the spam to my cousin...  http://t.co/cc4NsUz6j9
@Melissaaa_Annnn have a good day!  play well with others!! so excited for you!!
never trust your little brother home alone with a car and your new fish tank!! he'll buy a god damn eel and put it in your tank! 
got me twisted like an old beach roller coaster 
@BurgerKing: Exercise your right to snack. #ChickenFriesAreBack http://t.co/hbKYSuKmVW @GYounghans
