waiting for computer start programs to start
@tricksterzzzzz just crash a lot into the moon and connect them with docking ports
I own 12 3ds carts http://t.co/nz15KSMYYc
I hope my zelda case arrives soon
I think my emerald cart is in the other gameboy ;-;
@N94able Y was a gift
@Tricksterzzzzz yeah I play sandbox, I never have the fuel and kinda want a munbase
@TobiHatter it shows which one has 400 hours and which has 30 minutes
@N94able cause I wanted to get the game the day before the release and bought X and then Y arrived next day
And honestly it really shows
I love how I've only played one of these http://t.co/yixbldA7nX
@AussieRiolu @SleepyJirachi hell yes!
@AussieRiolu @SleepyJirachi oh god they're back, so now jirachi has to make an update for the downdate about the update
My spine does not comply with movement
@ThatBellaFern Nawh
@Tricksterzzzzz apart from that one rocket that majorly exploded that now stands near the launchpad with his pilot next to it
@Tricksterzzzzz I don't go back ever
@Tricksterzzzzz I land on whatever side is closest, I'll ram a bunch of lights on my ship
@Tricksterzzzzz I can do everything else fine it's the fact I cannot see how close I am to the moon because it's is pitch black
@Tricksterzzzzz I can never time myself to turn off the speed up, because I can't see squat I can't tell when I have to stop
@Tricksterzzzzz I can't really see the numbers cause where my chair is, I just kinda have to judge it myself
@trohmaan understandable
@Tricksterzzzzz to slow it down
@Tricksterzzzzz I run out of fuel, rockets with more fuel won't take off. I keep speeding up time then not being able to judge the distance
Might as well get on the server and make more mutandis
I can feel my hands getting colder :/
@trohmaan I've never met a single youtuber. ;-;
@Tricksterzzzzz I gave up after hitting the mun twice and then overshooting it
Ugh
@OCDexter if so why?
@OCDexter did you block/unblock me so i would unfollow you and you'd unfollow me?
@MrHighscore_ some consoles aren't bad
Who's idea was it at the council to cut grass at9am
Going to sleep not that it matters to anyone I'm pretty much talking to myself as usual
Oh right I forgot &gt;.&gt;
@xLChpoe what happened?
@Gumma_Radiation I'm not even ever gonna watch it
@Gumma_Radiation i have never seen that movie and do not plan to
@Gumma_Radiation OH GOD NOT UP ITS BUTT THATS CRUEL just cellotaped to it
This describes my life http://t.co/yPiK4YKtNi
@Gumma_Radiation it's the Same thing, I want a sugar glider ;-; or a hedgehog
@FaucetUnicorn  I AM NOT A MORON! WOULD A MORON PUNXH YOU INTO THIS PIT?! oh...
@Gumma_Radiation you're probably better off buying a guinea pig and cellotaping a curled up pipe cleaner to it's rear
@Gumma_Radiation wouldn't you lose it?
@s0rryimalex I'm not judging no one
@xLChpoe gargle something fizzy if you have it, it always works for me
@orlanothing dm
@orlanothing sure
My usual cheer up song isn't helping :/
@therealpogger5 @TheWeirdChild_ 's rt in case you were wondering
Not gonna RT what that person did but I agree..
@orlanothing ditto
This can't be? Was this me? I think I've lost control. I caused this. I forced this. Cannot continue on
Bye bye you'll probably all be happier if I'm not here. Goodnight
Ugh bad night
I feel sick
I only get stomach pains when I eat so it's not hard to cut off the cause
@Meowstical @SleepyJirachi hitmontop
Stomach pains are always fun to go with this mood. Yup
Sigh
@Meowstical spinda
Why don't they paint lucario yellow and make him the masc.... Oh wait
I need to talk to someone but it isn't happening.. No one around sigh. Ohwell
