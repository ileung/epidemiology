It'd be just a little easier if I didn't have to walk with crutches at school.  Bunion surgery kills u  http://t.co/hqxamB0rpl
People always got something to say like, why you gotta be so rude?
Don't save the easiest part for last. Do the hardest part first so you get it done
My niece Alexis  Always miss her haha http://t.co/IW1CPbLAga
Saw the cutest little boy at Target today!! He said 'the lizards coming for you!' Lol too adorable 
My friends get like 150 likes on their pictures and the most I get is like 12

Don't let other people run your schedule, it won't go as planned 
I just want school to start already so it can be over and I can graduate #Class2015

@colleenstaudt29 Yeah that's truee but if so it can be a mistake that you know for sure not to do again
@colleenstaudt29 I think it's better to give another chance... If they screw it up it's their fault and loss. Not yours!! #NoRegrets 
@colleenstaudt29 haha post a picture! 
@colleenstaudt29 you got them off?!
It can be easy to get someone to fall in love with you. It's only hard when you eventually find out their not the one
Giving someone a second chance isn't stupid. Messing up that second chance is.
I'm really tempted to sing Backstreet Boys now
They're playing some really old music at this restaurant
I'm pissed I missed Aladdin on Disney Channel
When you get deodorant on your shirt &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

The Jungle Book is a good ass movie
They seriously have the most stupidest toys in happy meals now.

@colleenstaudt29 I know you can come over whenever!! I can walk outside(: &amp; I love Penn state dude it seems like it'd be a good one to go to
@colleenstaudt29 Haha that's cool tho where are u thinking of going? And it's okay, can't really go a lot of places with this crippled foot
@colleenstaudt29 Same here! How's your summer ??
@colleenstaudt29 I liked the light show the best 
@colleenstaudt29 That place was fun!! 
So this old man at Little Caesars got up and opened the door for me while I was holding my pizza on my knee scooter. Made my night #LoveHim
When I'm pissed and I'm texting I put a period after every single sentence or word I say.
Got a picture of where they shot the movie FOREST GUMP! (THE BENCH SCENE)  http://t.co/WWUmx5p3Tl
I really hate stitches. They are so irritating 
I can't stand when girls will continuously play with their hair in videos when they sing. You ain't cute 
Men.... Smh
Tomorrow, please be better for me. And the day after tomorrow, please be better than tomorrow.
Sorry to remind people about this but....I'm stressed about school and it didn't even start yet 
It's the cute guys u gotta watch out for!! Lol sike nah it's all guys.
I thought of something funnier than 24 
If blankets weren't a thing I probably couldn't survive
I can't sleep at all, so looks like I'm cleaning
My music goes from Wiz Khalifa to Victoria Justice.  Judge me, bitch! 
Fast texters actually piss me off. Lol
@SemirTheGreat I know (: I'll get through it
@SemirTheGreat Hell yea  I can't believe how many u had
Idc what anyone else says, drugs and shit does change you. It's ruined friendships of mine just cuz I don't do it
@SemirTheGreat Lol me too yo! Just chillen, dealing with the surgery.
@SemirTheGreat what have u been up too!?
@SemirTheGreat  you're funny!
I hate when random guys will be like 'how'd u sleep?' Like why do u care?
If you feel like you can't make it in life, you can. Believe me.
K if I don't reply to your first 4,000 snapchats why would u still keep sending me them. 
Why am I so interested in this fairly odd parents episode lol
@M_C_Dreamy hahaha good  my day is better now!
Wish she wasn't mad at me. Seems like everyone's mad at me and I didn't do one thing
What's life without challenges?
Today is just not my day
When someone randomly decides that they don't like me. &lt;&lt; Well ALRIGHT THEN
Dang my mood changed quick.
There's always a Debbie downer about summer, I'm Debbie this time. Fuck u surgery. Fuck. You.
I hate when people are mad at me for no reason
It's driving me crazy not cleaning but I can't clean with one leg on the ground
No more brace face  http://t.co/LEO4K7LqY5
Bet you'll break up like tomorrow. Sorry not sorry
Couples who just start dating and already post stuff like 'I'm in LOVE with him and HE'S MINE!' are so annoying.
Literary I can't go out for weeks. This surgery is the worst thing that ever happened to me. Never been more depressed.
@Renee_Lyon3 You're the best person ever, thank u!! Lol
I swear I always end up eating papa johns pizza and watching the haunting hour in the same day
Halloween this year is on a Friday!!!  #Trick-Or-Treating #2014
I feel like a damn rock star ridin this knee scooter around my house getting shit done !
It's really sad how many negative assholes we have in this world.
DAMN IT! Dropped my headphones in my fucking gatorade. I'm so pissed 
I'm soo tired but I still wanna go out
Got a knee scooter today! Hopefully that'll help me more than these crutches
Don't be stressed, be blessed!
