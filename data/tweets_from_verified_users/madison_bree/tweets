@Bayyyllleee: I have a serious craving for genjis right now. this is you like 95% of the time!
But really all I want to do is fall asleep, must that be so diffecult? #sleepy
The fact that I can't sleep without a blanket and my dad won't put the air conditioning on any higher is creating a bit of a problem
If you want to be skinny in college then ferris is not the place for you #foodheaven

My dad loves mountain men so when the electricity finally comes back on we use it to watch people living without it #wewerejustdoingthat
How unfortunate would it be to have the last name dokakis brunnberg?

My dads new nickname for him- Osama bin harden #whatafunnyguy
So does anyone actually like harden? #seriousquestion
@sylvs_tweets: @madison_bree she always does that! @Tay_and_Bray and it needs to stop!
The best way to be woken up is definitely to have your sister come into your room and turn all the lights on then leave and slam the door
@AmandaOlenczuk wrangler of course, Levi was probably napping while he performed the crime in secret!
@AmandaOlenczuk purple nikes, brand new! &gt;:{ my favorites, but you know me I couldnt stay mad for long, his eyes just get me!
