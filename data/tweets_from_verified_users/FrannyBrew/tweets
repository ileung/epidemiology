What good is livin' a life you've been given if all you do is stand in one place?
If I was only judged by the contents of my purse (granola bar, Kleenex, hard candy) people would think I was an 88 year old grandma.
Beautiful things don't ask for attention.
@a_lundahl Mom really just wanted to prove me wrong because I didn't believe it was her. It then became a competition.
May or may not have chased down Christie Whitbeck in the mall so Judes and I could say hi.
