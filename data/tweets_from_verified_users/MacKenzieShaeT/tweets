I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist 
Sometimes I just don't understand
This glow in the dark nail polish is the bomb 

This is the first night I haven't hung out with Nik in 4 days 
"@MyTwatterNamex: My boyfriend scratches my back so basically he's a keeper " basically
Scary movie night with @Nikohsaur

@Nikohsaur @miilkkk hush 

Such a great feeling to be 100% happy 
This is stupid
@Nikohsaur don't care
I hope you do invite Sam over. Nice idea jermane.
I don't need your permission on who I can and can't hang out with.
Don't you tell em what we do, don't tell em don't tell em
I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll, so if that's what you're into go ahead and move along 
I hate school
Forever crying myself to sleep bc I'm a big baby 
Nobody even listens
I wish I was at the beach 
All we do when Austin is over is eat 
This is a depressing day
Guess I expected too much from you.
Nik is great at basketball 
Nik bought me candy, so clearly the best boyfriend award goes to himmm
I can't deal with school.

Trying to get your top eyeliner even is the hardest thing ever.
Kind of excited for Friday

Kinda want some chocolate, but kinda want something salty.

Say what you want about my car but I love it. For 1 it's purple and 2 it has GREAT gas mileage. Only had to get gas 4 times in 3 months
