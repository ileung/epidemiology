My ice bucket challenge...https://t.co/X9HrqSNWyH see who I nominate #ALSIceBucketChallenge #als
A #ChampionsLeague performance from Marco Lopes tonight - well done at #Lille tonight. Another great young talent.
Really proud and pleased to see @Jasondenayer starting with Celtic tonight in the #ChampionsLeague
Really happy for @EdDzeko - Not a bad way to start the season with MOTM against Newcastle and a new contract. Well deserved my friend.
I accept the Ice Bucket challenge from Dennis Bergkamp @Persie_Official...see who I nominate in the video on Friday @alsassociation #ALS
5 yr contract for @VincentKompany is so well deserved. Everyone knows what a great player he is, but more than that, a great man and captain
Congratulations to the little magician @21LVA on his new 5 year contract. A player that I love to watch playing.

Welcome to the Club @Elia22Mangala, good to have you with us.
Happy to learn #Brazil will benefit from @WesternUnion &amp; @UNICEFs #education efforts. Proud to be an @wu_PASS ambassador &amp; see great work
Special congratulations to @JB17Official for this fantastic success. Enjoy it, my friend!


Well done to #GER. Best team from the start won. They deserve it, not just for their performances in 2014, but for their last 4 tournaments
Both defences have been excellent. I hope one team wins it before penalties as I know how difficult it is to lose that way.
I want to congratulate @Persie_Official and the whole Dutch team for their performance in the tournaments too#WorldCup #BrazilVsNetherlands
We always knew how good the Dutch were going forward but this #WorldCup they've shown their skill in defence. They really deserve this.
#allin or nothing - @adidas advice seems to be working #WorldCupFinal #germany #argentina #worlcup2014
Wishing I was back with the @itv panel so I could watch Martin O Neill fight with @fabiocannavaro ... and be part of the argument
Really happy for @JB17Official and @MesutOzil1088 #BRAGER
Tonight Germany showed how a collective and disciplined structure wins over individual performances. Congratulations to you Germany#BRAGER
The World Cup is the biggest party of all... I had a great time being part of this: http://t.co/VaK3l3hgrD #allin or nothing
Feeling sorry for our players because they're out of the competition without playing at their best. But over all they had a good tournament.
Frustrating first half,showing too much respect. We have to be more brave &amp; play at our full potential which we haven't done yet.
Allez les bleus, ce soir c est #allin or nothing!
Algeria - you have not just made your country proud, but all of Africa. Keep your head up, and congratulations for what you have achieved
Hope it doesn't hurt too much to watch the French win @fabiocannavaro @leedixon2, let me know if you need any support 
Congratulations to the #french team, it will take a lot to beat them now. Once again it was a fantastic team performance #WorldCup2014
I found @fabiocannavaro after the game last night #worldcup2014 http://t.co/bvgANb0qSY

Getting flashbacks sitting next to Martin O'Neill, feel like being back in the tunnel with Keane...need to sort him out...like in the tunnel
A fantastic team performance from #france. You can see Benzama's talent-he was the main man. If he continues like that, they go a long way
