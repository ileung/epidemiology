If you're going on dates with Kyungsoo, remember never to be late :)) http://t.co/fANf9Dia7z
My life's pretty frustrating right now and I don't know how to turn things around. I can't follow my sun. Where should I really look?
If only someone like Junmyeon can trust my skills and fund me. Hehe. Oh well.
It's kind of sad I let time pass and I actually don't have much money for med school.
Truth is I want to be a medical doctor and watching this kind of drama hurts me by reminding me of that thing I actually dream of.
@DelacruzHarry /raises both hands/ love your header btw!
Someone give me a job I need to go to Korea with my bestfriend next year haha /cries
Loading  ep 9 haha I think I should study Korean while loading it...
@sooyeonjessi yup and that's basically talking to the "world" :)) #intlfans

@seludotcom I can imagine Suho having a twin sister and oh god they'd slay. Haha.
@sooyeonjessi i deactivated mine bec... well it's more fun to tweet with fans anyways haha :))
I want to buy Taemin's solo album but I'm so broke and EXO's having a comeback oh god I need jobS.
Last week in Etude, I was after an umma in the counter and she has an MCM bag oh wow rich umma haha. She has pretty skin too btw.
I used to have a personal twitter acct but I ended up not using it. I'm more comfortable tweeting w this fandom ahaha :))
Rich and kind-hearted Junmyeon donated then his rich and kind-hearted fansites donated too. Such wow. Much donations. :3
I wanna watch Kai and Taemin do Pretty Boy on a music show alreaddddyyyy. P-p-p-p-p-pretty boy! 
@sooyeonjessi yes he'll be that bully and protective hyung/oppa haha 
This is the power of fandoms: Known personalities inspiring people then fans themselves multiply the good acts.
I love you Sehun you're such a cute dongsaenggggg~
So is Sehun's IG the official PR account of EXO? Jk :))))))
I salute everyone who donated not just the popular people we know. I hope I can donate too. 
Junmyeon's so blessed and so kind, he didn't think twice of donating. Huhu you're my leader and inspiration!!! I love you Junmyeon!!!
