Cold feet
My grandpa just left the vehicle running while I pumped gas and he didn't even realize it. #losingit

BIRTHDAY MONTH 
I need a workout partner 
I hate Mosquitos and the birds arguing over who was the early bird. #StopChirping
I'm actually close to death
I got to cuddle with someone the past two nights and tonight I get my kitty #luckygirl
Before you give someone the world, make sure they're thankful enough to not pollute it.
@sicksadsound let's go skinny dippin 
#TeamUSA
69%
@sicksadsound Tina! Lol
SO to my coworker for getting me free wings from bdubs! 
@sparksnicolle try using snap. karissa.rettler so I can show you my clean closet 
@sparksnicolle maybe you should try being nice and you wouldn't have had to worry about it...
@sparksnicolle oh and I hate to break it to you but I didn't fail my exams, in fact I got two a's and two b's. Sorry 
@sparksnicolle I don't live in Seymour, I live in black creek, so that's closer to appleton. Idk if I can make it half way
@sparksnicolle anymore? Well sorry but I need a moped to make it to the falls...
@sparksnicolle hey! The clothes are actually nice but I don't want them! Jordan stuff and all. 
@sparksnicolle I just cleaned out my closet and half of my clothes went to the garbage, you can have those  so now about that moped...
@sparksnicolle you're not the only one &amp; I need a moped 
But tonight I'm cleaning out my closet 
Usher is a beautiful man
Put our heads together and think on it 
Uncertain feelings fading
@sicksadsound I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SEE YOU TODAY BUT THEN NO 
@sicksadsound aka customers and then my face gets red and I look to you for help haha 
A guy from another country, who has a heavy accent, just told me I have an accent &amp; asked if I was from wisconsin
@BBloedorn75 Nooo!  You'll have to catch me up to date when I see you next
@BBloedorn75 just wait until next year! You'll meet so many people you won't remember names lol
Second guessing is an awful thing
False hope
@sparksnicolle gosh damn, maybe I will, maybe I won't.
@sparksnicolle aww, thanks sweetheart, you are too kind. I'll let you know how they end up 
@sparksnicolle @erinblohm no, just giving me some entertainment and time away from studying 
@sparksnicolle @erinblohm that wasn't my job. And I actually had a few along with the grand slam, so bring it down a little
@sparksnicolle @erinblohm in a conference that has almost no talent. Hrs are weak, grand slams are beauty. Lol 
@sparksnicolle @erinblohm watch yourself. Sorry I don't play left field where no balls go...
@sparksnicolle @erinblohm now that would be a game 
@sparksnicolle gdi! Well they tried by the looks of it!
@sparksnicolle: Hey @karissarettler .. what are you teaching those Seymour girls?! http://t.co/Wh6HkmDxoy @erinblohm 
@sparksnicolle haha  I taught them to do whatever it takes to win and to make up for lack of talent 
@krabbitt45 Anthony hasn't even showed up but alright
@krabbitt45 Anthony can meet at 6 so I'll be there around then too, can you make it?
SOS
Such a great day spending and seeing the people I care about most #littlethings
Rub my tummy until I fall asleep so I know it's real
@MA_Johnson1_ respect man! Can I get a shirt within the next week?!
This day already sucks
Mike Posner is party hoppin in slosh! 
#FullEFFeKK that's my bro!! #Bars 
@DaniOlson4 @MA_Johnson1_ I want a shirt!! Where did you get it?!
SO to the girl who spends everyday writing her and her boyfriends name with hearts on a piece of paper in class
@krabbitt45 sounds good!!!
@krabbitt45 Anthony works till 9:30 but is coming after and we didn't talk to terry
@krabbitt45 hey! You wanna meet tonight at 9:30?

I hope @KaitlynRettler and @erettler had a wonderful birthday! #twins #cousins #loveya 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BAE @LarsenMcKenna 
@Hallie_Jiskra don't move to black creek, you'll have a suspended license indefinitley!
And now he said he'll see me around.
The cute guy that smells good in my Econ class talked to me today. But then wouldn't stop.
Someone I would willingly lose sleep over
I don't think my eyes will stay open much past 9 
If I make it through today without falling asleep somewhere it'll be successful #exhausted
Maybe I'll change my clothes and shower tomorrow, just maybe.
@sicksadsound funny thing, the prof rescheduled to tomorrow lol. But thank you bb
I look like a freak today but that's okay cause hopefully I do well on this exam 
@GoshDanggitOppy aww you're the best Alex! Thank you!!
