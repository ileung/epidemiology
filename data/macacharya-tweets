@nickgenes is birth also prior authorization?
@MichaelGaspar @MDaware @nickgenes context: I agree with no handshakes; the braying is much ado about nothing, an illuminating ado though
@MichaelGaspar @MDaware @macacharya @nickgenes it's a fine idea. Usually only scientifically sound ideas guide practice and public discourse
@trivialworld #dangerzone
@medschooladvice @MDaware mirror
@trivialworld as in my tweets provide the oxygen that drives the world?
@MDaware @nickgenes @HIMSS #hooah
@nickgenes @HIMSS foregoing handshakes not the first sign of a decline in civilization #Bieber but misses the point #fleasonanelephant
@ChrisRRegan @MDaware no I don't. I need my shoes #ThanksObama
@nickgenes still better than Windows 7.
Going to hang out with #sinaiemresidents, done with rotation.
@Yarmouth_Road @MDaware but not all tests that delay dispo are unnecessary
@lynneguist @patricox Good point. Some think journalists skimp on sources :-).
@AriBFriedman @JMedInternetRes http://t.co/9LzjSagQS7
@mcclure111 @LukeMaciak I wish the annotations to the picture were a font, very pretty.
@nickgenes this too shall pass
@JMedInternetRes problematic methodology- used a black box to identify user demographics
@NetworkFact it is a measure of how easily the flows in a network can synchronize
@CompSciFact so true, at least in industry.
@meganranney @philiplederer @pnatarajanmd @ArtKellermannMD how does one make data actionable?
@AnalysisFact but is all meat a linear combination of chicken?
@Erowid public cant isn't real disapproval, it's exploitable polarization.
@LukeMaciak depends on which doctor. I though matt smith's regeneration ini the new guy was weaker than tennant -&gt; smith.
@ValaAfshar @MDaware @om consultants can tell you what to do-- synergize.
@hyperplanes @MDaware but they are spelled similarly and both sound so technical.
@EMtogether @meganranney @lsaldanamd that's what you think
@nickgenes #meta
@Erowid past some point you can't fix stupid, especially with legislation
@AlimPardhan @nickgenes except if you stay up too long you go insane and can't use that time well. But, counter-example to this- Borges
@nickgenes yes, especially if capture voice and text
@nickgenes still faster than a "modern" cab in Brooklyn
@Erowid perhaps increases in amount of pre-gaming useful as  as a marker of tolerance?
In DC for #assfn2014 #neuromodulation
@nickgenes @ashishkjha @sarahkliff lest we smugly let it die prematurely #symbolic
@ManiniAlex @Erowid sounds like an opportunity for #ToxTweet
@fredthum so hand over heart when the attending walks in?
@TeXtip what about booktabs?
@onceuponA @MDaware might help to calculate on a per user basis rather than aggregate
@spinedocnyc @nytrosenthal this was a really important article, docs shouldn't be the whipping boys
@GeriaSonoMD @MDaware @screamingmd perhaps more like until hospital feels legal exposure
@MDaware Limes are the new tulips.
@EMEducation @EMDocBrett @MDaware ah, thx --&gt; completely agree
@nickgenes @Doctor_V @srrezaie someday we won't have to think of professionalism, we'll all evolve
@EMDocBrett @MDaware @EMEducation I don't think that is its purpose. Assimilation and promulgation?
At #brooklynhalf, the usual hurry up and wait
@DDossick @meganranney absolutely, and make some version of that data available for analysis by the interested public
@nickgenes @getpager @GirlCalledWasp  #zocdoc might phagocytose this. Great idea.
@CompSciFact I still can only remember what a monad is for about ten minutes.
@roseperson @MDaware @dontgetcaught sounds like more of a last minute check (hopefull)
@sciencemagazine older memories maybe less stable in new/different network?
@nickgenes @techonomy thither
@afrakt @MDaware inception tw (tweet) eet
@EMSwami @MDaware @srrezaie @aaronbrightmd premature optimization can cause many problems.
@nickgenes @mashable but developing insight, the next step, doesn't often have ready made solutions.
@nickgenes @gigabarb ToxTweet will
@LukeMaciak reminds me of that scene in real science
My new article: Synchrony can destabilize reward-sensitive networks http://t.co/FleCkbWt0Z via @sharethis
@mikedewar http://t.co/tStXfqnLuS
@mikedewar Sun-Ichi Amari demonstrated: if each probability distribution is a point, KL is the curvature of the path connecting them.
