I wish they made The Golden Compass 2.
I really, really, really, don't want to go to school tomorrow.
@jamesxmartin school I so gay and I hate it.
@LillianJune we should hang out sometime then.
@LillianJune I miss you to.
@Logan_Zimm thanks.
@Logan_Zimm yeah I was trying to rock my Ninja Turtle shirt.
@Logan_Zimm you looked great homie.
Follow my dude @kobetaylor22 he is the man!
@NatallieElaine and maybe Bryan Rooker you should invite people to.
@NatallieElaine I am trying to get the whole state of Ohio to go but so far I only got Kristen and maybe Logan but I will for sure get more.
@NatallieElaine this Friday coming up.
@NatallieElaine are you trying to go see the turtles?
@kdawgthoo I'm so weak!
@Logan_Zimm okay.
@Logan_Zimm Friday.
@Logan_Zimm indeed.
@Logan_Zimm  lets go then homie.
Who is trying to see the Ninja Turtles with me when it comes out?
@KMcferron I'm weak!
@KMcferron I am the biggest loser.
@KMcferron maybe but no guaranteed.
@KMcferron am I wrong?
@KMcferron who doesn't.
Watching Paul George get messed up hurt me just as much as it did him.
@RookerBry I am so jealous, that looks amazing.
Jimmy Kimmel dancing to Chandelier changed my life forever.
Don't you know what it is like to fall for someone, even though you know in your hart that it will probably never work out.
@KMcferron I am for sure trying to get creamy whip. Anytime.
So weak! http://t.co/pfI6oNA99n
@codyxkrug For sure I will.
@codyxkrug I am going to throw up that X.
@codyxkrug that is the only one that matters.
Come to stones and hangout.
