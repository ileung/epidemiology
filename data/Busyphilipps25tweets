@BillyNillesDUH it made me lol, so thank you! Xx

@edwarddroste @matsoR loving the haircut on Rostam!
@SimplyNikki thank you! It's @marahoffman !!! Love her stuff!!!
I'm on #Undone tonight with @amandadecadenet on @lifetimetv right after Project Runway! Tune in!! It's LIVE! Eek!!
@edwarddroste @LarzMarie you rocked it out bb!
@daniel_rentzer @nrodea @HollywoodLA311 @HollywoodHelper @LAScanner It woke me and my husband up- shotgun? Car backfire? Def NOT THUNDER.
Sometimes I see someone taking a selfie and I get so embarrassed for them I can't breathe.
@slimsv hahahaha! Amazing!!!
@anneacurrie no! I agree! They should get treatment here! I just think the whole thing is crazy scary!!
@JarettSays it's beyond. This world is insane. It's no wonder people would rather just read celebrity gossip. Dark times. DARK TIMES. :(
@JarettSays Wait. What do you mean?!
Maybe it's because I've seen the movie Contagion like four thousand times, but this Ebola thing has me really freaked out.
@shapewithangela @KChenoweth @elsacollins @soulcycle Just what I needed!!! Xx
Creative juices are flowing at our house on this beautiful day! #tiedyepartyfor2 #BBBestSummer http://t.co/X9NydweJpm
Just watched #DrunkHistory-@MarkGags made me laugh so hard!!! Best drunk ever!
Sometimes my friend @frauleinfutz would join. And once, we made each other running playlists.
Little known fact: @derekwaterss and I were in a "run club" in 2007 which just consisted of us running at 24hr fitness a few days a week.
Super excited to be on #DrunkHistory tonight! I had so much fun filming it--I can't wait to watch!!!
I can honestly say, I have NEVER been happier to be home than I am right now.
@GuyHenry_7 weird!!!!
Who knew that Merge 25 would be hotter than coachella?? @mergerecords Such a fun show!
@Grantland33 @emilyyoshida this might sound weird but I've been waiting for this article for 3 days. Thank you!
I have been having so much serious deja vu lately, I'm starting to believe in the Matrix. Or hologram theory. Or something. :/
@foodeonline thanks! We had a great meal!
@POPSUGARMoms thank you!!
Bravo @IanThorpe! Big love to you for your bravery &amp; eloquence! XOX

@jennyslate @bananaboat BB, you are invited over whenever you want! I have a feeling you are the kindof girl Birdie would love to swim with!
@JarettSays I love how Cricket looks like she's dancing. And matching suits!
Keeping these smiling faces safe in the sun with a little help from my friends at @BananaBoat. #BBBestSummer http://t.co/vtlL09MRzT
@yasminATlesauce That's so great! Next time, come say hi and we'll share dessert!!
@HishamBharoocha especially when there's an island with its own agenda...
@abbyrprice yup. Been there too...
I just put together my own first aid kit for traveling. IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING, I'VE TURNED INTO MY MOM.
I accidentally broke a glass so hard tonight that it basically turned into glitter. :/
Today is "dress like your favorite star" at camp and Birdie requested to dress like "Rachel from Friends" THIS IS MY CHILD!
After super sleuthing all day (AKA looking out my window twice) I can't imagine there's filming going on inside that house.Cookies tomorrow!
@CaitlinDineen you are def on my Harriet the spy vibe!
@theJoshuaAdam literally the most boring reality show ever.
Need to figure out my 1st move- bake cookies and casually walk them over to "welcome" them to the neighborhood??
The rumor in my neighborhood is the house across the street has been rented out for a reality show-I'm about to go full Harriet The Spy...
Post @soulcycle with my #1 White Chick, @J2thecarpenter!!! http://t.co/7KnAC1F4Lv
@shannonwoodward So weird! I've been doing this!! Seriously. But I think I give off more of a weird mom vibe when it comes from me.
I'm not sure if it's because it's hot out or cause I'm feeling nostalgic for high school but all I want to eat is iced non fat lattes.
Watching fireworks from our balcony&amp; Marc got stung by a bee so now we're inside watching Freaks &amp; Geeks on FXX Happy 4th of July.
Cricket's cake is finished!!! Happy 1st birthday to my little one. http://t.co/ruhUiZK4xi

@Caissie obvi.
@Caissie this line of thinking is how Marc&amp;I ended up buying a vintage photo booth,shipping it cross country,&amp; craned into our house. :/

I had a really good time on #TheSoupLive with @joelmchale &amp; you can tell cause I'm standing on one foot in this pic! http://t.co/MHQWhwDEO7
We all can agree that the news is the worst, right?
@diorabaird1 I wrote a check last week and dated it 2013. :(
Party bus ceiling selfie! The baby is rocking out to Baby Beluga &amp; Birdie is drinking 7up out of a red plastic cup. http://t.co/xBJOkL6NwF

The transportation that was sent for is at the airport is an actual party bus. I am horrified &amp; can't stop laughing. http://t.co/vf1mnqxHbR
@MarkDuplass :/ I get it.
@morgan_murphy it's totally fair that I'm traveling with the 2 kids and he gets to sleep, right?
@morgan_murphy hahahaha. That's how he rolls on planes.

I am beyond proud of @IreneNeuwirth and her #CFDAAWARDS nomination. And I am SO excited &amp; honored to be her date tonight!
Growing up, we never had a nanny or housekeeper but in my head she was always a mix between Alice &amp; Oprah. #RIPAnnBDavis
@momaw41 :)
Words cannot describe my excitement to see @ActuallyNPH in one of my favorite shows ever. http://t.co/z9fXnmaLZt
@momaw41 I don't! But I felt it necessary to speak out about all the click-bait trolling from one comment.
@CTWorkingMoms @bobbiejo123 thank you both! Love this!!
Here you go:  http://t.co/Rg5hJMB6kb
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm finished with work for the day, I'm putting my phone away and gonna go spend time with my kids.
Sadly, the internet is all about hits. And salacious headlines get the most. It's trolling and everyone is guilty these days&amp;it bums me out.
I was asked about MY experience. Not any one else's. THAT is all I know. STOP trying to recreate Mean Girls. I won't be a part of it.
@JarettSays yes. Yes I am.
My position is every woman has a different life experience&amp;worldview. I hate this pitting moms against moms-it's BS and has to stop.
JUST TO BE CLEAR- I'm not trying to "smack down" or "set the record straight" about actress moms....
@Abdaddy I mean... Xoxo
@jenperos @usweekly hahahaha! At least I didn't dig out all the trash at the bottom!!!
.@VDOOZER wrote something! I mean, other than a script. Read it! http://t.co/Wcp8Jwo2Er
A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY to @ChristaBMiller! She's an incredible mom, wife,actress,friend&amp;she does it all looking hot in skinny jeans&amp;flats.
Levar Burton is awesome! I just backed Bring Reading Rainbow Back for Every Child, Everywhere. on @Kickstarter http://t.co/BKptepdVkG
@0iloveolive0 @JoeyGraceffa great job!!!! Love it!!
@scottybiggs84 best wishes for a long and happy life together! Happy wedding!!
I honestly think my husband's least favorite part of bring married to me is zipping me into dresses.
My friend @Ricky_Webster is KILLING desserts at @lachapterca @acehotel. I broke my diet for this&amp;would do IT AGAIN! http://t.co/anJVM1hsuH
@danbucatinsky I'm DYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RobinShorr I AM! Today! I think you night miss me more than my children.
.@CougarTownTBS reunion at the #tbsTNTupfronts! It's Grayson's baby mama! Who's on @GroundFloorTBS! @BrigaHeelan! http://t.co/P1u7nZDHDq
@campsucks can I please have it too? I feel like that's maybe for everyone...
Happy Mother's Day to ALL the moms! Especially to my mom, who inspires me everyday to be the best mom I can be. http://t.co/Xd9wq3Ofu7
